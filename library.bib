abstract = {General equations are derived for evaluating the contributions of the non-penetration displacements to the apparent Young's modulus and hardness measured in an instrumented microindentation test. An idealized disk model is proposed to simulate the roles of porosity and sample displacements in determining Young's modulus and hardness from the indentation curve. The model is then applied to experimental data obtained from the indentation tests completed with separated and bonded yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) thermal barrier coating layers. It is shown that in an instrumented microindentation test of a thin material plate, large scatter in the mechanical properties may originate from non-penetration displacements which usually increase with decreasing sample thickness. Predictions are also made for the apparent E-H values and show reasonable agreement with the measured data. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science Limited.},

abstract = {Fundamentally, it is advantageous to operate an aeroengine's thermodynamic cycle at as high a turbine entry temperature as practical for the current metallurgical limits of the turbine blades in order to achieve peak cycle efficiency and thus lower specific fuel consumption. However, achieving the highest possible turbine entry temperature requires accurate knowledge of the turbine blade temperatures for control purposes to prolong component life as frequent excursions beyond the design limits of the blades can severely reduce their service life. The optical pyrometry technique represents the best method for providing this crucial temperature data needed for blade condition-based monitoring. This paper presents the general operating principles, system aspects and design considerations for the application of the optical pyrometer instrument for inflight service use on gas turbine aeroengines.},

A complete wireless sensor system consists of such a SAW transponder and a local radar transceiver, is widely discussed. The antenna of the SAW transponder receives an RF burst in the VHF/UHF band transmitted by the radar transceiver. The reader unit performs a radar measurement of the impulse response of the SAW transponder via a high-frequency electromagnetic radio link. A temperature variation changes the SAW velocity and thereby the response pattern of the SAW device. By analyzing the time delay between backscattered pulses with different time delays we get a coarse estimation of the temperature of the SAW transponder. By using this information the ambiguity of ±2$\pi$ in the phase differences between the pulses can be eliminated, which provides to an overall temperature resolution of ±0.2°C.},

abstract = {The most vital step in the development of novel and existing surface acoustic wave (SAW)-based sensors and transducers is their design and optimization. Demand for SAW devices has been steadily increasing due to their low cost, portability, and versatility in electronics, telecommunications, and biosensor applications. However, a full characterization of surface acoustic wave biosensors in a three-dimensional (3D) finite element model has not yet been developed. In this study, a novel approach is developed for analyzing shear horizontal Love wave resonator devices. The developed modeling methodology was verified using fabricated devices. A thorough analysis of the 3D model and the experimental device was performed in this study including scattering parameters (S-parameters), reflection coefficient parameters, transmission parameters, and phase velocity. The simulated results will be used as a design guideline for future device design and optimization, which has thus far resulted in close matching between prediction and experimental results. This manuscript is the first to demonstrate a 3D finite element model to correlate the sensitivity of the SAW device with the magnitude of the phase shift, the real and imaginary part of the response, insertion loss, and the frequency shift. The results show that the imaginary part of the response shift has a higher sensitivity compared to other parameters.},

abstract = {Guided ultrasonic waves are of significant interest in the health monitoring of thin structures, and dispersion curves are important tools in the deployment of any guided wave application. Most methods of determining dispersion curves require accurate knowledge of the material properties and thickness of the structure to be inspected, or extensive experimental tests. This paper presents an experimental technique that allows rapid generation of dispersion curves for guided wave applications when knowledge of the material properties and thickness of the structure to be inspected are unknown. The technique uses a single source and measurements at two points, making it experimentally simple. A formulation is presented that allows calculation of phase and group velocities if the wavepacket propagation time and relative phase shift can be measured. The methodology for determining the wavepacket propagation time and relative phase shift from the acquired signals is described. The technique is validated using synthesized signals, finite element model-generated signals and experimental signals from a 3 mm-thick aluminium plate. Accuracies to within 1{\%} are achieved in the experimental measurements.},

In the demand of new characterization and evaluation techniques, nondestructive ultrasonic techniques have shown a good potential to characterize the microstructures and mechanical properties of a wide variety of materials. Measurements of ultrasonic parameters such as velocity and attenuation can provide information on the structural and microstructural variations of those materials that have undergone the heat-treatment procedure. In the current review, the correlation of ultrasonic parameters with microstructural features of ferrous and nonferrous metals such as steels, aluminum, and superalloys is investigated. It is proven that ultrasonic parameters are closely correlated to the microstructural evolutions which frequently occur during the heat-treatment procedures in practical situations. To conclude, the ultrasonic measurements contribute to a feasible and accurate characterization of the materials and evaluation of their microstructures and mechanical properties in a straightforward, reliable, and fast, nondestructive manner for practical applications.},

abstract = { Environmental requirements to reduce CO 2 emissions and the drive towards higher efficiencies have resulted in increased operating temperatures in gas turbines. Subsequently, Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEMs) require improved component design and material selection to withstand the harsher conditions. This demands rapid evaluation of new components and their surface temperature to accelerate their market entry. Accurate temperature information proves key in the design of more efficient, longer-lasting machinery and in monitoring thermal damage. A number of traditional temperature measurement techniques are available, but can incur a number of limitations. Online temperature measurements, such as pyrometry or phosphor thermography, often require optical access to the component during operation and are therefore not suitable for inaccessible components. Other options including thermocouples can only provide point measurements and cannot deliver profiles across the surface. Offline techniques store temperature information that can be measured and analysed following operation. Several of these, however, are of destructive nature, can affect local thermal gradients and only provide point measurements. This article discusses an innovative offline measurement technique: luminescent Thermal History Paints (THPs). THPs are comprised of ceramic pigments in a binder matrix that can be applied to any hot component as a thin coating. These pigments are doped with optically active ions, which will phosphoresce when excited with a light source. The coating material experiences irreversible structural changes depending on the temperature it is exposed to. Changes in the material structure are reflected in its phosphorescent properties, which are measured with standard optical instrumentation at any surface location. Since the changes are permanent, the temperature information is stored in the coating and can be extracted after operation. Following calibration, it is therefore possible to relate phosphorescent behaviour to the past maximum temperature experienced at each location. This is done with Sensor Coating Systems Ltd. (SCS)'s portable instrumentation, which can provide rapid, automated and objective measurements across a component surface. Unlike the more traditional thermal paints, THPs are non-toxic, and provide a continuous measurement capability across the range 150°C–900°C with significantly improved durability. This article describes the underlying principles behind this novel technology and the advantages it provides over existing state-of-the-art methods. The benefits will be demonstrated through measurements on nozzle guide vanes (NGVs), with the view to compare and validate them against thermocouple measurements. The results show that the THP extends the limited information from thermocouples to provide a more complete view of the thermal processes on the component. },

abstract = {Lamb waves can propagate over long distances which means that they are attractive for the quick, long range inspection of large structures, and they can also be useful for localized inspection, particularly in thin structures. This paper discusses the selection of the appropriate mode and frequency range for different inspection requirements and reviews the possible methods of excitation, response measurement and signal processing. It is usually desirable to transmit a single, non-dispersive mode, and excitation methods to achieve this are discussed. A variety of signal processing techniques from simple time domain to relatively complex two-dimensional Fourier analysis are available. Time domain processing can often be applied satisfactorily in low frequency-thickness regions where only two modes can propagate, but tends to be unreliable above the cut-off frequency of the a1 mode. As an example of the design of a Lamb wave testing regime, a set of tests on a butt-welded steel plate with simulated weld defects of different depths is described. It is shown that by operating below the a1 cut-off frequency with judicious selection of testing technique, the presence of defects can be detected reliably from changes in the shape of the received waveform. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

To study the feasibility of this technique for full-scale gas turbine applications, a high momentum confined jet combustor at 8 bar was used. Successful measurements up to 1700 K on a ceramic surface are shown with good accuracy. In the same combustor, temperatures on the combustor quartz walls were measured, which can be used as boundary conditions for numerical simulations. An atmospheric swirl-stabilized flame was used to study transient temperature changes on the bluff body. For this purpose, a high-speed setup (1 kHz) was used to measure the wall temperatures at an operating condition where the flame switches between being attached (M-flame) and being lifted (V-flame) (bistable). The influence of a precessing vortex core (PVC) present during M-flame periods is identified on the bluff body tip, but not at positions further inside the nozzle.},

abstract = {In the future gas turbines and aero engine designers will try to improve efficiency and reduce emission of pollutants, in particular NOx. The former is and will continue to be achieved by an increase of the turbine entry temperature. To ensure the integrity of the components, which are exposed to these temperatures, novel cooling schemes are being developed and ceramic protective coatings are employed to reduce the thermal load. However, air is also needed for the combustion processes in order to reduce emissions, so that the amount of air available for cooling is limited. To make most effective use of the cooling air a detailed knowledge is required of the temperature distribution on the components of interest. Surface temperature measurements in operating engines are only possible using a few techniques. Commonly used examples are thermocouples, thermal paints or pyrometry. Relatively new is the application of phosphorescent materials to remotely detect temperatures on turbine components and even on rotating blades, combustor walls or on reacting solid propellants. The method involves excitation of a thin layer of material with UV light and observation of the subsequent phosphorescence in the visible part of the spectrum. Some of the phosphorescent properties are temperature dependent such as lifetime decay, intensity of the emission lines and the shift of emission lines. The calibration of these properties can provide a tool for temperature detection. This method is called phosphor thermometry. It was intensively employed for gas turbine applications in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s but was less applied in Europe. In the present study the reader will be introduced to some of the physical fundamentals of phosphor luminescence and the utilisation of the optical properties for temperature measurement. A database of thermographic phosphors has been generated for temperatures in the range from room temperature to 1400oC the latter being believed to be the maximum temperature achievable with this technique. A new previously unknown thermographic phosphor was identified and studied. The results were published in [1] and also now form a part of a global database of rare earths at the ‘Rare-earth Information Center' Ames Laboratory. During the project, a novel concept was introduced that combines thermal barrier protective coatings with the luminescence properties of phosphors. This concept is called ‘smart coating' or ‘thermal barrier sensor coating' and is currently the subject of an international patent application which has already been identified as a ‘patentable invention' by the European Patent Office in December 2000 [2]. Prototype coatings have been fabricated and successfully tested for temperature sensitive properties. It has proven possible to detect subsurface temperatures and there were also indications that structural changes inside the coatings can be measured, a feature which might be used for lifetime assessments of coatings during operation in the future. A thermographic phosphor was used to measure the surface temperature distribution inside a Rolls-Royce research combustor. The combustor was operated at atmospheric pressure and is of the type, which is used in helicopter engines. A temperature profile of a target area in the central part of the combustor was obtained with a spatial resolution of 0.7mm and covering an area of 7x7.5mm2. Ejection holes were clearly identified as heat sinks revealing temperatures between 300oC and 350oC with hot areas showing temperatures between 550oC and 600oC located between the cooling holes. The line-of-sight was directed through the flame of the combustor, which was running under take-off conditions. This ability to measure surface temperatures in the presence of flames is perhaps the most substantial difference between thermographic phosphor thermometry and other optical techniques.},

abstract = {Four methods of range measurement for airborne ultrasonic systems - namely simple thresholding, curve-fitting, sliding-window, and correlation detection - are compared on the basis of bias error, standard deviation, total error, robustness to noise, and the difficulty/complexity of implementation. Whereas correlation detection is theoretically optimal, the other three methods can offer acceptable performance at much lower cost. Performances of all methods have been investigated as a function of target range, azimuth, and signal-to-noise ratio. Curve fitting, sliding window, and thresholding follow correlation detection in the order of decreasing complexity. Apart from correlation detection, minimum bias and total error is most consistently obtained with the curve-fitting method. On the other hand, the sliding-window method is always better than the thresholding and curve-fitting methods in terms of minimizing the standard deviation. The experimental results are in close agreement with the corresponding simulation results. Overall, the three simple and fast processing methods provide a variety of attractive compromises between measurement accuracy and system complexity. Although this paper concentrates on ultrasonic range measurement in air, the techniques described may also find application in underwater acoustics.},

abstract = {Suffering from solar radiation, day–night replacement and seasonal changes, the structure will produce notable temperature behaviour, which has a vital effect on the long-term process of the health monitoring. Previous studies show that there is a significant correlation between the measuring responses and temperature from health monitoring systems. To analyse the structural state more accurately, much literature employed health monitoring methods considering temperature effects. This paper reviews technical research concerning health monitoring of civil structures under varying temperature. Firstly, the correlation researches of structural measuring responses (dynamic and static responses) and temperature are reviewed, which includes the researches of the influence mechanism and the data statistics, and the studies of the influence of non-uniform temperature on responses are also reviewed. In addition, different types of separation and forecast methods of the temperature-induced part of the structural responses data are summarized, followed by a brief summary of benefits and drawbacks of these methods. Lastly, the recently proposed process frameworks of damage assessment considering temperature effects are also introduced.},

abstract = {Smart sensors are necessary to measure the surface temperature of the key aero-engine components such as nozzle guide vane – one of the key parts receiving the highest heat after the gas combustion. Traditional sensors such as wired thermocouple (TC) are cumbersome to implant into the system due to its large size and hard installment. In this article simple yet effective TC array was formed by a series of Pt soldering dots on the PtRh thin film on the thermal barrier coating (TBC) on turbine blade substrate. The PtRh thin film was fabricated using MEMS technology to pattern thermocouple on the curved surface of nozzle guide vane. Heating experiments were performed using ethanol and acetylene flame, calibration is carried out in muffle furnace. The distribution of the measured thermal voltage from the sensor array agrees with temperature distribution caused by the ethanol heating flame responsively. Temperature cycling tests were also performed to test the robustness of such sensors. In addition other types of smart sensors were also formulated and tested: Pt/PtRh sensor with two layers of Pt and PtRh thin films overlapping into thermocouple joint on TBC and simple dot-like sensors using YSZ TBC as a thermistor to monitor the surface temperature on the TBC coating. The advantage of the former sensor is the minimum turbulence to the heat flows on the vane surface while for the latter an easy economical way to monitor the surface temperature on the turbine blade.},

Recently, in order to take full advantage of the potential of the TBC systems, experimental and analytical investigations in TBC systems have been performed. However there is a little information on the deformation behavior of the top coating. In addition, the effects of the thermal exposure and the process parameters on the mechanical properties of the top coating have never been clarified. From these backgrounds, the effects of the process variables in APS and the thermal exposure on the mechanical properties were investigated in order to optimize the APS process of top coatings. The experimental results indicated that the mechanical properties of the APS-TBC, i.e. the tensile strength and the elastic modulus, were significantly changed by the process variables and the long term thermal exposure. The microstructural investigation was also carried out and the relationship between the mechanical properties and the porosity was discussed.},

abstract = {Torsional guided wave inspection is widely used for pipeline inspection. Piezoelectric and magnetostrictive transducers are most commonly used to generate torsional guided waves. These types of transducers require bonding or mechanical contact to the pipe which can result in changes over time which are undesirable for structural health monitoring. This article presents a non-contact Lorentz force–based electromagnetic acoustic transducer for torsional guided wave monitoring of pipelines. First, the excitation mechanism of the transducer is simulated by analyzing the eddy current and the static magnetic field using the finite element method. An electromagnetic acoustic transducer transformer model is presented which describes the eddy current generation transfer function and the ultrasound excitation. Independently simulated eddy current and magnetic fields are used to calculate the Lorentz force that an electromagnetic acoustic transducer array induces on the surface of a 3-in schedule 40 pipe, and an explicit finite element solver is then used to simulate the elastic wave propagation in the pipe. Then, the reception mechanism and the expected received signal levels are discussed. The construction of an experimental transducer is described, and measurement results from the transducer setup are presented. The measured and modeled performance agree well. Finally, a monitoring example is presented where an artificial defect with 3{\%} reflection coefficient is introduced and successfully detected with the designed sensor.},

abstract = {For corrosion detection, it is often desirable that a Lamb wave mode is highly sensitive to surface thinning and enjoys some degree of mode purity at a particular frequency. In view of this, this paper aims to generate a variety of Lamb wave modes over broad frequency bands to ensure an abundant supply of candidates for corrosion detection, and further, establish a strategy to find appropriate operation points efficiently and effectively. Firstly, a short-duration laser pulse is applied to generate Lamb waves over a large frequency-thickness product range. The selection of symmetric modes or anti-symmetric modes is obtained by addition or subtraction of signals captured by two identical transducers which are symmetrically coupled on both sides of the plate. Subsequently, the S0 mode at a non-dispersive frequency bandwidth is employed to improve the accuracy of the transmitter-receiver distance. Based on those, three selection criteria including mode separability, amplitude ratio and corrosion sensitivity, are presented to efficiently determine the suitable operation points (i.e., mode types and frequencies). The experimental results show that the simulated corrosion could be correctly detected and accurately localized at the chosen modes and frequencies.},

@article{Sfar2002,
abstract = {Due to thermal expansion mismatch and bond coat (BC) oxidation, high residual stresses are induced in the thermal barrier coating (TBC), leading to failure by spalling and delamination. Using the finite element method (FEM), an analysis of the stress distributions in TBC systems, which is a prerequisite for the understanding of failure mechanisms, was performed. As cracking usually occurs at or near the interfaces between BC/thermally grown oxide (TGO) and TBC/TGO depending on the processing mode of the TBC, cracks in the interface region were considered in the FE models in order to determine the loading conditions for their propagation and, thus, the failure criteria of the TBCs. Due to the mode mixity of these cracks, suitable methods are required for the determination of the fracture mechanics parameters needed for their assessment, such as the strain energy release rate G. The modified crack closure integral method (MCCI) was found to be a very efficient tool which can be combined easily with an FE analysis and leads to highly accurate energy release rate values. Moreover, this method enables the determination of mode-dependent energy release rates. Using this tool and appropriate crack propagation criteria, TBC failure models could be developed and verified. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Oblique incidence is one of the most known methods to generate and receive Lamb waves and it is applied in different experimental arrangements with different types of sensors. In this work, several setups were conducted and compared to determine the optimal ones to launch and detect ultrasonic Lamb waves, especially in non-homogeneous specimens. The chosen arrangements were contact with angle beam transducers, immersion in a water tank, localised water coupling using conical containers and air coupling. Plates of two different materials were used, stainless steel and Portland cement mortar. Theoretical and experimental dispersion curves were compared to verify the existence of Lamb modes and good correspondence was achieved.},

abstract = {Microwave acoustic devices have long been shown to provide sensitive platforms for physical and gas sensors. Piezoelectric substrates introduced over the past two decades, such as the langasite (LGS) family of crystals, gallium orthophosphate, and aluminum nitride have enabled the exploration of microwave acoustics sensing at temperatures above 500°C. However the ability of the substrate to withstand high temperatures is only one of the requirements for sensor operation in harsh environments. Other prerequisites are: the development of stable high-temperature device electrodes; appropriate packaging; and resilience of the entire system to thermal shock and thermal cycling. In this paper, the wireless operation of microwave acoustic wave sensors in harsh environments is reviewed, and recent achievements are highlighted. Particular focus is given to surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor technology because it has the advantage of being wireless, battery-free, and allows interrogation of arrays of multiple devices. During the last decade, wireless hostile environment microwave acoustic sensors that can detect gases and monitor temperature and pressure have transitioned from laboratory proof-of-concept to commercial devices and systems. Recent accomplishments in thin film technology and packaging are extending the technology to even higher temperatures, beyond 1000°C. These technological advances are enabling wireless microwave acoustic sensor applications in hostile environments including power plants, turbine engines, oil/gas refineries, and high temperature industrial processing. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {1.0 Introduction Temperature measurement in today's industrial environment encompasses a wide variety of needs and applications. To meet this wide array of needs the process controls industry has developed a large number of sensors and devices to handle this demand. In this experiment you will have an opportunity to understand the concepts and uses of many of the common transducers, and actually run an experiment using a selection of these devices. Temperature is a very critical and widely measured variable for most mechanical engineers. Many processes must have either a monitored or controlled temperature. This can range from the simple monitoring of the water temperature of an engine or load device, or as complex as the temperature of a weld in a laser welding application. More difficult measurements such as the temperature of smoke stack gas from a power generating station or blast furnace or the exhaust gas of a rocket may be need to be monitored. Much more common are the temperatures of fluids in processes or process support applications, or the temperature of solid objects such as metal plates, bearings and shafts in a piece of machinery. 2.0 The history of temperature measurement There are a wide variety of temperature measurement probes in use today depending on what you are trying to measure, how accurately you need to measure it, if you need to use it for control or just man monitoring, or if you can even touch what you are trying to monitor. Temperature measurement can be classified into a few general categories: a) Thermometers b) Probes c) Non-contact},

The HOMC-GW is a recently explored phenomena which is found to occur at very high frequency-thickness product i.e. 15 MHz.mm to 35 MHz.mm. 2D ABAQUS finite element simulations were used to decide the optimal wedge angle which facilitates the generation of the HOMC-GW. Experiments were carried out on a 6 inch diameter mild steel pipe with machined pin hole type defects of various diameter and depth. A commercial 2.25 MHz, 1 inch diameter transducer mounted on a machined acrylic wedge was used. The potential of axially propagating HOMC-GW on pipe like structures is being brought into light. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The objective of this investigation was to compare the results of metallurgical temperature sensors and thermocouples when used to measure piston temperatures in a running engine. Type J thermocouples and a microwave wireless telemetry system were used to gather real time temperature data on the piston in the vicinity of each metallurgical sensor. Eight pairs of metallurgical temperature sensors were installed in the piston with a thermocouple junction in-between. The engine was ramped up to steady state quickly and then held for approximately 4h at 1800 rpm and 1980Nm before being quickly ramped back down in accordance with the metallurgical sensors' recommended test cycle. During the test, continuous temperature data at each of the sensor locations were monitored and recorded using the telemetry system. After the test was complete, the metallurgical temperature sensors were removed and independently analyzed. The results indicate that readings from the metallurgical temperature sensors were similar to those of the embedded thermocouples for locations without large thermal gradients. However, when thermal gradients were present, the metallurgical sensor's reading was influenced measurably. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 by ASME.},

abstract = {It is advantageous to operate the thermodynamic cycle of an aeroengine at as high a turbine entry temperature as practical for the current metallurgical limits of the turbine blades, in order to achieve peak cycle efficiency and thus lower specific fuel consumption. However, achieving the highest possible turbine entry temperature requires accurate knowledge of the turbine blade temperatures for control purposes to prolong component life, as frequent excursions beyond the design limits of the blades can severely reduce their service life. The optical pyrometry technique represents the best method for providing these crucial temperature data needed for blade condition based monitoring. However, this method of non-contact temperature measurement is subject to a number of errors inherent to the gas turbine operating environment. In this paper we present the general operating principles and an overview of the measurement errors associated with optical pyrometry, together with a discussion of the techniques to prevent, limit and compensate for such errors resulting from the turbine environment.},

In this study, we demonstrate their functionality for subsecond pulsed laser heating (isothermal duration of ≈ 10 ms) up to 1773 K, with evidence suggesting functionality to even higher temperatures. This large range is due to the formation of a new mixed-material phase (similar to yttria-stabilized zirconia) that results in spectral features that are not seen in the component materials on their own.

abstract = {Turbine blade surface temperatures were studied during transient operation in a turbofan engine test rig. A single fiber radiation pyrometer was used to view the suction side of the blades from approximately 60{\%} axial chord to the trailing edge at an average radial location of 70{\%} blade height. A single ceramic-coated blade produced a once-per-revolution signal that allowed for the tracking of individual blades during the transients. The investigation concentrated on the light-off starting transient and the transients obtained during accelerating and decelerating between power settings. During starting and acceleration transients, the blade surface temperature gradient was observed to reverse. This phenomenon was most apparent during starting when the trailing edge was initially much hotter than the 60{\%} chord location, resulting in large temperature gradients. In steady operation, the trailing-edge temperatur e was lower than the 60{\%} chord location, and the gradients were less severe. During deceleration transients, the trailing edge cooled more rapidly than the 60{\%} chord location. This resulted in larger temperature gradients than were seen in steady operation, but no profile inversion was observed. These temperature gradients and profile inversions represent a cycling of thermally induced stresses which may contribute to low-cycle fatigue damage. A simple one-dimensional heat transfer model is presented as a means of explaining the different heating rates observed during the transients. {\textcopyright} 1993 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.},

abstract = {It is desirable for any structural health monitoring (SHM) system to have maximum sensitivity with minimum sensor density. The structural health monitoring system described here is based on the excitation and reception of guided waves using piezoelectric elements as sensors. One of the main challenges faced is that in all but the most simple structures the wave interactions become too complex for the time domain signals to be interpreted directly. One approach to overcoming this complexity is to subtract a baseline reference signal from the measured system when it is known to be defect free. This strategy enables changes in the structure to be identified. Two key issues must be addressed to allow this paradigm to become a reality. First, the system must be sufficiently sensitive to small reflections from defects such as cracking. Second, it must be able to distinguish between benign changes and those due to structural defects. In this paper the baseline subtraction approach is used to detect defects in a simple rectangular plate. The system is shown to work well in the short term, and good sensitivity to defects is demonstrated. The performance degrades over the medium to long term. The principal reason for this degradation is shown to be the effect of change in temperature of the system. These effects are quantified and strategies for overcoming them are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Existing thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) can be adapted enhancing their functionalities such that they not only protect critical components from hot gases but also can sense their own material temperature or other physical properties. The self-sensing capability is introduced by embedding optically active rare earth ions into the thermal barrier ceramic. When illuminated by light, the material starts to phosphoresce and the phosphorescence can provide in situ information on temperature, phase changes, corrosion, or erosion of the coating subject to the coating design. The integration of an on-line temperature detection system enables the full potential of TBCs to be realized due to improved accuracy in temperature measurement and early warning of degradation. This in turn will increase fuel efficiency and will reduce CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} emissions. This paper reviews the previous implementation of such a measurement system into a Rolls-Royce jet engine using dysprosium doped yttrium-stabilized-zirconia (YSZ) as a single layer and a dual layer sensor coating material. The temperature measurements were carried out on cooled and uncooled components on a combustion chamber liner and on nozzle guide vanes (NGVs), respectively. The paper investigates the interpretation of those results looking at coating thickness effects and temperature gradients across the TBC. For the study, a specialized cyclic thermal gradient burner test rig was operated and instrumented using equivalent instrumentation to that used for the engine test. This unique rig enables the controlled heating of the coatings at different temperature regimes. A long-wavelength pyrometer was employed detecting the surface temperature of the coating in combination with the phosphorescence detector. A correction was applied to compensate for changes in emissivity using two methods. A thermocouple was used continuously measuring the substrate temperature of the sample. Typical gradients across the coating are less than 1 K/lm. As the excitation laser penetrates the coating, it generates phosphorescence from several locations throughout the coating and hence provides an integrated signal. The study successfully proved that the temperature indication from the phosphorescence coating remains between the surface and substrate temperature for all operating conditions. This demonstrates the possibility to measure inside the coating closer to the bond coat. The knowledge of the bond coat temperature is relevant to the growth of the thermally grown oxide (TGO) which is linked to the delamination of the coating and hence determines its life. Further, the data are related to a one-dimensional phosphorescence model determining the penetration depth of the laser and the emission.},

abstract = {The properties of electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) for using the symmetrical vertical mode-(S0) Lamb wave and the shear horizontal fundamental mode-(SH0) plate wave were experimentally studied. The EMAT, consisting of a meandering coil and an electromagnet, can effectively transmit and receive the S0 mode Lamb wave and the SH0-mode plate wave in a thin metal plate. For ferromagnetic materials, such as steels, the magnetostriction is important for the transduction. The wave amplitude is not proportional to the static field strength, but is dependent on the magnetostrictive properties of the material. In this study, the amplitude and the phase of the S0 mode Lamb wave and SH0 mode plate wave generated by the EMATs are measured while changing the static field strength to the sheets. The amplitude of the S0-mode Lamb wave in a low carbon steel sheet initially decreases with a static field to the minimum value, then increases again accompanying the phase inversion by 180° and finally decreases without any phase inversion. The amplitude of the SH0 mode plate wave in a low carbon steel sheet initially increases to the maximum value with the static field, then decreases to the minumum value and increases again accompanied by a phase inversion of about 90°. These data were discussed on the basis of the magnetostrictive curve to the magnetizing current of an electromagnet in low carbon steel sheets.},

abstract = {Surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices have been shown recently to be an appropriate technology for harsh-environment sensor applications, such as those in the automotive, aerospace, power plant, and metallurgic industries. Usages include temperature, pressure, torque, strain, gas, liquid, biochemical, and mass sensors in structural health monitoring, industrial process monitoring, environment checking and control, and condition based maintenance. For harsh-environment high-temperature applications, battery-free wireless operation associated with sensor robustness, small profile, and mass fabrication capability make SAW sensors a very attractive solution. For high-temperature ({\textless} 800°C) gas sensor applications, the stability of SAW sensor platform including protective and sensing film layers must be guaranteed over time and under temperature cycling conditions. This paper reports on the performance and stability of langasite SAW resonator (SAWR) sensor platform using PtAl2O3-based electrode, with atomic layer deposited (ALD) Al2O3 protective layer and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) gas sensing layer. The effect of 50nm thick Al2O3 or YSZ layers on SAWR sensor resonant frequency and temperature sensitivity responses were investigated. Temperature sensitivities of SAWR sensors with and without ALD Al2O3 protective layer have been compared with numerical predictions for a bare substrate. Measured temperature sensitivities of SAWR sensors with and without the YSZ sensing layers have been compared against each other. In addition, the stability of the SAWR sensor frequency responses have been monitored during multiple 110-hour temperature cycling (over 620 hours in total) from 300°C to 750°C. The measured frequency deviation at 750°C over six of these 110-hour cycling tests was 0.05{\%}. The results obtained confirm that the presence of the ALD Al2O3 protective layer or the YSZ sensing layer do not compromise the stability of high-temperature harsh-environment SAWR sensors, validating their use for the aforementioned applications.},

Therefore, there is growing interest in gaining knowledge on the mechanical properties of the cell materials for stress analysis. This study compiles available data from the literature on the mechanical properties of the most common materials used in intermediate-temperature anode-supported cells: nickel and yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) anodes, YSZ electrolytes, yttria (YDC) or gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) compatibility layers and lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) or lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF) cathodes. The properties for the simulation of stresses, i.e. coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, creep behaviour and strength are reported, with an emphasis on temperature and porosity dependence and the evolution upon aging or cycling when available. Measurements of our Ni(O)-YSZ anode material includes the CTE (oxidised and reduced state), Young's modulus and strength at room temperature (oxidised and reduced) and 1073 K (oxidised). {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.},

abstract = {The damage identification process provides relevant information about the current state of a structure under inspection, and it can be approached from two different points of view. The first approach uses data-driven algorithms, which are usually associated with the collection of data using sensors. Data are subsequently processed and analyzed. The second approach uses models to analyze information about the structure. In the latter case, the overall performance of the approach is associated with the accuracy of the model and the information that is used to define it. Although both approaches are widely used, data-driven algorithms are preferred in most cases because they afford the ability to analyze data acquired from sensors and to provide a real-time solution for decision making; however, these approaches involve high-performance processors due to the high computational cost. As a contribution to the researchers working with data-driven algorithms and applications, this work presents a brief review of data-driven algorithms for damage identification in structural health-monitoring applications. This review covers damage detection, localization, classification, extension, and prognosis, as well as the development of smart structures. The literature is systematically reviewed according to the natural steps of a structural health-monitoring system. This review also includes information on the types of sensors used as well as on the development of data-driven algorithms for damage identification.},

abstract = {The influence of temperature is regarded as particularly important for a structural health monitoring system based on ultrasonic guided waves. Since the temperature effect causes stronger signal changes than a typical defect, the former must be addressed and compensated for reliable damage assessment. Development of new temperature compensation techniques as well as the comparison of existing algorithms require high-quality benchmark measurements. This paper investigates a carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) plate that was fully characterized in previous research in terms of stiffness tensor and guided wave propagation. The same CFRP plate is used here for the analysis of the temperature effect for a wide range of ultrasound frequencies and temperatures. The measurement data are a contribution to the Open Guided Waves (OGW) platform: http://www.open-guided-waves.de . The technical validation includes initial results on the analysis of phase velocity variations with temperature and exemplary damage detection results using state-of-the-art signal processing methods that aim to suppress the temperature effect.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In this work, three high temperature piezoelectric crystals, YCa 4 O(BO 3) 3 , LiNbO 3 and AlN, were studied for use in ultrasonic transducers under continuous operation for 55 hours at 550°C. The oxidation of AlN, known to occur at these temperatures, had no significant effect on the ultrasonic transduction efficiency, but the difficulty to achieve high quality AlN single crystals limits their applications greatly.

abstract = {For corrosion detection, it is often desirable that a Lamb wave mode is highly sensitive to surface thinning and enjoys some degree of mode purity at a particular frequency. In view of this, this paper aims to generate a variety of Lamb wave modes over broad frequency bands to ensure an abundant supply of candidates for corrosion detection, and further, establish a strategy to find appropriate operation points efficiently and effectively. Firstly, a short-duration laser pulse is applied to generate Lamb waves over a large frequency-thickness product range. The selection of symmetric modes or anti-symmetric modes is obtained by addition or subtraction of signals captured by two identical transducers which are symmetrically coupled on both sides of the plate. Subsequently, the S0 mode at a non-dispersive frequency bandwidth is employed to improve the accuracy of the transmitter-receiver distance. Based on those, three selection criteria including mode separability, amplitude ratio and corrosion sensitivity, are presented to efficiently determine the suitable operation points (i.e., mode types and frequencies). The experimental results show that the simulated corrosion could be correctly detected and accurately localized at the chosen modes and frequencies.},

After thermal exposure, however, the columnar structure degraded and the degradation depended on exposure temperature and time. The hardness and Young's modulus were higher on the plan-section than on the cross-section before and after thermal exposure.

Optimal composition of 12 mole{\%} Yittria stabilized Zirconia is slightly better than 8 mole{\%} Yittria Stabilized Zirconia based on the improved thermo-elastic properties for better performance at higher temperature (RT-400°C). However 15.5 mole{\%} YSZ seems to be more suitable from the view point of thermo-elastic performance at elevated temperatures (500-800°C). Polycrystalline properties predicted are within 5{\%} error limits of the experimental values for Young's modulus of 12 mole{\%} Yittria Stabilized Zirconia. Numerical prediction of Young's modulus of 12 mole{\%} YSZ for 〈100〉 orientation is 362 GPa as compared to experimental value of 370 GPa reported in literature. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.},

abstract = {Time-of-flight measurement is a critical step to perform ultrasonic non-destructive testing of standing trees, with direct influence on the precision of defect detection. Aiming to increase the accuracy on the estimation, the characteristics of the ultrasonic measurement chain should be adapted to the constraints of wood testing in living condition. This study focused on the excitation signal parameters, such as shape, temporal duration, and frequency response, and then the selection of a suitable time-of-flight determination technique. A standing plane tree was tested, placing ultrasonic receivers at four different positions, with five different excitation signals and three time-of-flight detection methods. The proposed ultrasonic chain of measurement resulted in high signal-to-noise ratios in received signals for all configurations. A time-frequency analysis was used to determine the power distribution in the frequency domain, showing that only chirp signal could concentrate the power around the resonant frequency of the sensor. Threshold and Akaike information criterion method performed similar for impulsive signals with decreasing uncertainty as sensor position approached to the radial direction. Those two methods failed to accurate determine time-of-flight for Gaussian pulse and chirp signals. Cross-correlation was only suitable for the chirp signal, presenting the lower uncertainty values among all configurations.},

@article{Belkin1998b,
abstract = {This dissertation explores the link between civil-military relations and international conflict. In particular, I ask whether strategies that leaders invoke to protect themselves from their own militaries might under some conditions increase the risk of war. Even though civil-military relations is fundamental to state-building, and despite the sizable literature on domestic causes of international conflict, there is very little work on the international implications of regimes' efforts to protect themselves from their own militaries. My argument is that when coups are possible, usually leaders divide their armed forces into rival organizations that they intend to check and balance each other and protect the regime as a by-product of mutual suspicion. (I label this strategy counterbalancing). Counterbalancing depends on leaders' ability to keep their own armed forces apart by promoting conflict among them. But military elites may rebel if they come to understand how leaders profit from inter-organizational hostility. Hence, counterbalancing requires leaders to conceal control benefits they accrue when they induce their own forces to compete. Because international conflict conceals these benefits, leaders may invent enemies, prepare for war, and engage in low-level international disputes when their foundational objective is to use counterbalancing to subordinate their own militaries. Contrary to the sizable literature on scapegoating, my argument is that in the realm of civil-military relations regimes may use provocative foreign policy to reinforce institutional divisions rather than to achieve cohesion. The argument is tested via a multi-method strategy that includes a pooled, time-series analysis of almost every country in the world over the last two decades of the Cold War as well as historical case studies of civil-military relations in Syria in the early 1970's and Georgia in the mid-1990's.},

abstract = {To shift the onset of thermal quenching by multiphonon emission to higher temperatures, thermographic phosphors for high-temperature applications are usually selected with a large energy gap between the radiatively emitting energy level and the next lowest energy level. An alternate approach is presented where Y2O3:Er, with a relatively small energy gap of 2795 cm−1 between the 4S3/2 emitting level and the 4F9/2 level below it, provides effective temperature measurements from room temperature to 1200 °C. The smaller energy gap results in an expanded temperature measurement range because (1) it results in a lower temperature onset of thermal quenching by multiphonon emission and (2) the smaller number of phonons required to bridge the energy gap produces a weaker temperature-dependent increase in multiphonon emission rates with temperature. Utilizing the intense hypersensitive 4I15/2 → 2H11/2 Er3+excitation at 522 nm offsets the temperature precision reduction due to the decreased decay time temperature sensitivity. Two distinct temperature sensitivity ranges are observed due to a crossover in multiphonon emission relaxation from high to low effective phonon energies at about 950 °C. The implications of this transition from high to low effective phonon energies for selection of dopant hosts for high-temperature thermographic phosphor applications are discussed.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to numerically simulate the Lamb wave propagation through a clamp-on ultrasonic gas flowmeter (UGF) in contact mode, using a new semi three-dimensional approach. Moreover, experimental and analytical modeling results for transit time difference method have been used to confirm the simulation results at different gas flow velocities from 0.3 to 2.4 m/s. Design/methodology/approach: The new semi three-dimensional approach involves the simulation of the flow field of the gas in a three-dimensional model and subsequently the simulation of wave generation, propagation and reception in a two-dimensional (2D) model. Moreover, the analytical model assumes that the wave transitions occur in a 2D mode. Findings: The new approach is a semi three-dimensional approach used in this work, has better accuracy than a complete 2D simulation while maintaining the computing time and costs approximately constant. It is faster and less expensive than a complete 3D simulation and more accurate than a complete 2D simulation. It was concluded that the new approach could be extended to simulate all types of ultrasonic gas and non-gas flowmeters, even under harsh conditions. Originality/value: In this work, a new approach for the numerical simulation of all types of ultrasonic flowmeters is introduced.

abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) is a relatively new and alternative way of non-destructive inspection (NDI). It is the process of implementing a damage detection and characterization strategy for composite structures. The basis of SHM is the application of permanent fixed sensors on a structure, combined with minimum manual intervention to monitor its structural integrity. These sensors detect changes to the material and/or geometric properties of a structural system, including changes to the boundary conditions and system connectivity, which adversely affect the system's performance. This book's primary focus is on the diagnostics element of SHM, namely damage detection in composite structures. The techniques covered include the use of Piezoelectric transducers for active and passive Ultrasonics guided waves and electromechanical impedance measurements, and fiber optic sensors for strain sensing. It also includes numerical modeling of wave propagation in composite structures. Contributed chapters written by leading researchers in the field describe each of these techniques, making it a key text for researchers and NDI practitioners as well as postgraduate students in a number of specialties including materials, aerospace, mechanical and computational engineering.},

abstract = {Non-contacting guided wave tomography based on laser ultrasonic waves permits inspecting structures that are inaccessible to traditional ultrasound methods. Such structures may be hard to reach, e.g. hot metal structures, metal implants inside tissue, and metals in chemically corroding environments. The shape of such structures is sometimes simple, which makes the propagation path of the guided waves well defined. A spherical structure requires that one accounts for multiple propagation paths and echoes of the guided waves. We set up a 3D multiphysics model in COMSOL Multiphysics Ⓡ to verify our measurement results of guided wave propagation on a hemispherical steel shell featuring a {\O}=9.5 mm hole. The time dependent multiphysics model uses the Heat Transfer module to model the laser excitation as a heat source on the hemispherical steel shell. There are two mechanisms for guided wave generation by laser excitation: thermal expansion and ablation. Only thermal expansion was considered since the contribution from ablation is negligible at low excitation energies. The Heat Transfer module was coupled to the Structural Mechanics module to model generation of guided waves with the Thermal Expansion multiphysics coupling. The predicted displacement on the outer rim of the hemispherical steel shell were compared to experimental results obtained with a system comprising an Nd:YAG laser excitation and a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) pickup. The simulated signals were first compared to measurement data for an intact hemispherical shell. Then to show the capability of damage detection, a simulation model of the hemispherical shell with a defect was analyzed.},

The verification is usually performed on the basis of results of test of full-size blade prototype on a gas-dynamic test bench. A method of calorimetric measurement in a molten metal thermostat for verification of a thermal model of cooled blade is proposed in this paper. The method allows obtaining local values of heat flux in each point of blade surface within a single experiment. The error of determination of local heat transfer coefficients using this method does not exceed 8{\%} for blades with radial channels. An important feature of the method is that the heat load remains unchanged during the experiment and the blade outer surface temperature equals zinc melting point. The verification of thermal-hydraulic model of high-pressure turbine blade with cooling allowing asymmetrical heat removal from pressure and suction sides was carried out using the developed method. An analysis of heat transfer coefficients confirmed the high level of heat transfer in the leading edge, whose value is comparable with jet impingement heat transfer. The maximum of the heat transfer coefficients is shifted from the critical point of the leading edge to the pressure side.},

The delay line device, where a transmitting and a receiving interdigital transducer are realized on a (piezoelectric) substrate is the most common structure used. The sensitive part is the surface between the two transducers. By placing the device in the feedback loop of an amplifier, an acoustic-wave oscillator is formed with properties such as inherent high sensitivity, high resolution, high stability and a frequency output signal which is easy to process. A very interesting development is the large amount of wave types now available for sensor applications. Sensors have been published using Rayleigh waves, Lamb waves, Love waves, acoustic plate modes, and surface transverse waves (STW). Each of these wave types have their special advantages and disadvantages with respect to sensitivity, stability, usability in liquids or gases, and fabrication complexity. For the fabrication of the acoustic-wave devices, planar technologies are used, which will be discussed in the paper. Examples will be given of gas sensors, biochemical sensors in liquids, viscosity and density sensing and high-voltage sensing. A comparison of the usability of the different wave types will be presented. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Within this context, the objectives of the present work have been achieved within two phases: (1) definition of Smart TPS concepts, study and selection of the most promising ones and (2) demonstration of their feasibility. After a trade-off approach, where the smart concepts have been evaluated versus system aspects, the two most promising were selected for proof-of-concept. The first one, based on Phase Change Materials (PCMs), provides increased safety by preventing the formation of hot spots in the primary structure. The second one is a thermosensitive painting able to retrieve information of the thermal history of the TPS after re-entry, enabling easier maintenance. Both concepts have been tested under simulated re-entry conditions at high temperature. It has been demonstrated that the use of PCM restricts the temperature achieved in critical zones of the primary structure notably lower than that achieved without PCM. In addition, outstanding accuracy of the thermal paints has been confirmed by comparison with thermocouples measurements. Excellent adherence with the substrate has been also confirmed under thermal cycling and plasma conditions.},

abstract = {Ultrasonic guided waves are used extensively when checking for defects in petrochemical and other industries and are mostly generated using piezoelectric transducers on an angled wedge or electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) in different configurations. Low-frequency inspection allows for long-distance propagation, but it is best suited for detecting relatively large defects, while at higher frequencies, the presence of multiple wave modes limit defect detectability, so achieving practical single Lamb mode excitation via careful transduction is very beneficial. This paper investigates the relative ability of angled piezoelectric and meander coil EMAT probes to produce single-mode transduction in the medium (1-5 MHz-mm) and high ({\textgreater}5 MHz-mm) frequency-thickness regions of the dispersion curves. The nature of each transducer is studied analytically by simulating the corresponding surface forces, followed by the use of a Fourier transform in time and space (2-D fast Fourier transform) to highlight the excitation region in the wavenumber-frequency space. With angled wedge excitation there is a linear relationship between the excitation frequency and the wavenumber which means that the excitation tends to track typical dispersion curves, allowing for easier pure mode generation. In contrast, the EMAT controls frequency and wavenumber separately which makes it more difficult to generate a pure mode when dispersion curves are close together; however, by narrowing the frequency bandwidth via a large number of cycles in the excitation signal, pure mode generation via an EMAT was shown to be possible even in areas of closely spaced modes. As example cases, analytical results, backed up by experiments, showed that signals dominated by the A0 mode at 1.5 MHz-mm and also the A1 mode at 18 MHz-mm can be generated with both angled piezoelectric and EMAT probes.},

abstract = {Fabricating sensor devices directly on metallic component requires the use of an electrical insulating ceramic layer between the sensor and the metal. However, most ceramics lose their electrical insulation with the increasing temperature. In this paper, electrical insulation properties of ceramic thin film were extensively analyzed in high temperature environment up to 1300 °C and a new ceramic coating with good high temperature insulation was developed. Results indicate that the ordinary YSZ ceramic film cannot maintain enough resistivity under high temperature above 600 °C. A new methodology is therefore proposed to compensate the possible errors of the sensors brought by the reduced resistivity in the ceramic. Meanwhile an improved ceramic coating recipe was developed to improve the electrical insulation which can meet the high temperature insulation requirement up to 1300 °C. Extensive numeric simulations considering electrical and thermal multi-physics interaction were conducted to analyze and estimate electrical performance under high temperature caused by the reduced resistivity of ceramic thin film onto which the thermal sensor is fabricated. Conduction current with the various thickness and defect situations in the ceramic thin film were studied through the extensive simulation, and a competitive behaviors of various current flows in this sensor/ceramic/metal composite structures is observed},

abstract = {Acoustic thermometry is capable of phenomenal accuracy, but is a difficult technique to apply in many practical situations. Here, we describe a modification of the technique, which permits robust temperature measurements to be made, potentially with millikelvin resolution, over a temperature range extending from cryogenic temperatures to over 1000 °C. The technique uses measurements of the time of flight of acoustic pulses in tubes, usually filled with an inert gas such as argon. The tubes-typically made of stainless steel with an outer diameter of 6mm-act as acoustic waveguides and can be several meters long and bent into complex shapes. The time of flight is determined by the average temperature along the entire length of the tube. Local temperature information can be inferred in several ways. Typically a second shorter tube is used and the difference in time of flight reflects the temperature in the region at the end of the first tube. If the measurement length is sufficiently long-typically 1m of tube-then a measurement resolution of less than 1mK is achievable. The technique is well suited to measurements in harsh environments in which conventional sensors degrade. Results from early tests are shown, which highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the technique. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.},

Proof-ofprinciple tests were conducted on phosphor-coated turbine blades that were rotating at low speeds and were immersed in a jet fuel flame. A pulsed nitrogen laser produced fluorescence from the applied phosphor. A simple optical scheme collected this emission, and a digital oscilloscope extracted from the signal the temperature-dependent decay rate. Measured temperatures ranged from 700-1000°C. These were comparable with values indicated by a pyrometer. Time-dependent temperature measurements demonstrated the transient capabilities of the thermophosphor technique. This is only the second time the phosphor technique has been implemented in a flame environment. The previous work involved a water-cooled object near 150°C. The current test was at a much higher temperature and incorporated a rotating object as well. The data provide important information for designing a thermophosphor system for future real-engine testing. {\textcopyright} 1990 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The early detection of failures in structures is a subject of great interest in engineering; several of these techniques are linked with the elastic wave propagation, using guided waves is one of these alternatives. Several structures of interest in engineering are laminar arrangements; the wave propagation in this type of structures depends not only on the material properties, but also on the geometric parameters, such as the plate thickness. Tubular structures, pressure vessels, tanks and also parts of ships hulls could be considered laminar. The elastic wave propagation in laminar structures could be considered as a sum of modal shapes that have its wave length and frequencies defined. These mode families are characteristics of each structure and could be represented through the dispersion curves. The definition of these dispersion curves is of crucial importance to understand the propagation of guided waves in the structure studied. In the present work the dispersion curves were generated using three different methodologies, specific for metallic rectangular stems that compound the strengthening armor in flexible riser duct. Each approach presented in the analysis were carried out using standard finite element commercial packages and an experimental verification, as well. The premise is to present the topics in the simplest way, not only to understand how the dispersion curves are built but also how these curves must be interpreted.},

Gas turbine cooling technologies have been investigated for more than 70 years and it has substantially changed in the course of new aircraft engine development. In this study, a nozzle guide vane (NGV) is designed and an efficient cooling system is investigated for a commercial aircraft engine NGV leading edge. The engine is developed for “AIAA Undergraduate Team Engine Design Competition” and it has extremely a high overall pressure ratio of 60. The cooling of NGV, Nozzle Guide Vane, is one of the most critical design issues in the whole engine design cycle. In the present study film cooling of an NGV is investigated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

abstract = {The increasing trend towards high-temperature, fuel efficient jet engines has led to the development of complex cooling schemes for the turbine blades. The measurement of temperature of the blade during operation, which is accomplished in conventional blade design by embedding wire thermocouples in the blade wall, causes serious structural and aerodynamic problems in the case of cooled turbines. In order to meet the requirement of temperature measurement in cooled turbines, it is desirable to develop surface-mounted thin-film thermocouples or a resistance thermometer. In the current state of the art of thin-film thermocouples, the sensing element consists of 2-$\mu$m-thick Pt and Pt 10{\%} Rh thin-film elements deposited on the insulating surface of the blades and vanes. The insulator is developed by thermal oxidation of a MCrAlY coating which is deposited on the blade and vane surface in the current state of turbine technology. The understanding of the structural and thermoelectric stability of the sensor elements and of the insulating layer of A1 2 O 3 in the hostile environment of a gas turbine requires an in-depth study of the metallurgical reactions occurring at the thin-film A1 2 O 3 and Al 2 O 3 -MCrAlY interfaces and of the corrosive reactions on the surface of the metal film. The work presented in this review addresses the problems associated with obtaining highly adherent and insulating A1 2 O 3 on the MCrAlY surfaces, adhesion of the sensor elements, thermoelectric stability of the sensors on contamination, and finally the development of a corrosion protection coating. The desired quality A1 2 O 3 has been grown on NiCoCrAlY-coated nickel-based superalloy substrates by a combination of oxidation treatments. The interface-modified Pt and Pt/Rh films are deposited on the oxide by a dc magnetron sputtering technique. The corrosion protection requirements involve deposition of Si-O-N and Si 3 N 4 graded structures on the sensors by the plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition process. Details of the electrical and metallurgical characteristics of the device at each stage of the coating/film growth have been analyzed by a number of surface sensitive and bulk analytical techniques. {\textcopyright} 1986, American Vacuum Society.

In this paper, we design a high-resolution ultrasonic ranging system that uses a thin laser beam as an ultrasonic sensor. The laser sensing provides a noncontact method for ultrasound detection based on acousto-optic diffraction. Unlike conventional methods, the ultrasound transmitted from the transducer is recorded as the reference signal when it first passes through the laser. It can be used to improve the accuracy and resolution of the time-of-flight (TOF) by a cross-correlation method. Transducers with a central frequency of 1 MHz and diameters of 20 mm and 28 mm are used in the experiment. Five targets and a test piece are used to evaluate the ranging performance. The sound velocity is measured by the sound velocity profiler (SVP). The repeatability error of TOF is less than 4 ns, and the theoretical resolution of TOF is 0.4 ns. The results show a measurement resolution within one-tenth of the wavelength of ultrasound and an accuracy better than 0.3 mm for targets at a distance up to 0.8 m. The proposed system has potential applications in underwater ranging and thickness detection.},

abstract = {The accurate real-time monitoring of surface or internal temperatures of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) in hostile environments presents significant benefits to the efficient and safe operation of gas turbines. A new method for fabricating high-temperature K-type thermocouple sensors on gas turbine engines using coaxial laser cladding technology has been developed. The deposition of the thermocouple sensors was optimized to provide minimal intrusive features to the TBC, which is beneficial for the operational reliability of the protective coatings. Notably, this avoids a melt pool on the TBC surface. Sensors were deposited onto standard yttria-stabilized zirconia (7-8 wt {\%} YSZ) coated substrates; subsequently, they were embedded with second YSZ layers by the Atmospheric Plasma Spray (APS) process. Morphology of cladded thermocouples before and after embedding was optimized in terms of topography and internal homogeneity, respectively. The dimensions of the cladded thermocouple were in the order of 200 microns in thickness and width. The thermal and electrical response of the cladded thermocouple was tested before and after embedding in temperatures ranging from ambient to approximately 450 °C in a furnace. Seebeck coefficients of bared and embedded thermocouples were also calculated correspondingly, and the results were compared to that of a commercial standard K-type thermocouple, which demonstrates that laser cladding is a prospective technology for manufacturing microsensors on the surface of or even embedded into functional coatings.},

abstract = {This paper presents a theory for ultrasonic B-scan image formation. Our theory is based on the assumption that imaging is done using broad-band signals and that all the information in the returned echos is utilized for image formation, as opposed to only the "video" detected envelopes. We also assume that the image is formed from the backscattered returns caused by inhomogeneities within soft tissue structures. In other words, we do not take into account the contributions from the specularly reflecting surfaces that represent large impedance discontinuities. (Surfaces that only represent small impedance changes and are "visible" to the transducer are accounted for by our theory.) Our main reason for this omission is the fact that although the contributions of the surfaces with large impedance changes are important to the delineation of features in some B-scan images, it is the presentation of the backscattered echos from small inhomogeneities within the tissues that is more severely distorted by the radiation and the electromechanical properties of the transducer. Also, it is currently believed that the backscattered echoes from the small inhomogeneities within the tissues carry important pathological information. Our theory is also limited to the case of linearly scanned transducers with unfocused apertures. A major result of our theory is an analytical expression for the point spread function of the image degradation. As expected, this function is position variant. To simplify the computations required for image restoration, we have presented approximations that reduce the point spread function to the position-invariant form. We have shown experimentally that the resulting restoration filters retain their effectiveness over several centimeters of the object thickness. This has led us to conclude that the B-scan images of thick objects may be restored by using piecewise position-invariant techniques. {\textcopyright} 1980.},

The responsiveness of the waveguides was also investigated. While ultrasonic measurements can be made at very high frequencies, the responsiveness is limited by the heat transfer into the active sensing area. The waveguides make it easy to customise the dimension of the active sensing area and a shorter response time than those of RTDs has been demonstrated.

Furthermore, improvement in the sensitivity is also achieved through the selection of the aluminum nitride sensing system. The overall combination of the Lamb wave generation and receiver-sensing system in this study is found to be very promising for a broad range of noncontact NDT{\&}E applications.},

The considered substrate materials are lithium niobate (LiNbO3), quartz and langasite (La3Ga5SiO14). In addition, electrode materials and assembly, interconnect and packaging strategies are discussed or examined. Delay lines on LiNbO3 had low SAW attenuation up to approx. 550°C. The frequency response disappeared completely at about 800°C. Delay lines on quartz had low SAW attenuation up to 500°C, a temperature being significantly below the phase transition from $\alpha$- to $\beta$-quartz at 573 °C. Delay lines on La3Ga5SiO14 withstand extreme temperatures: a SAW response was observed up to 1060 °C. The progressive destruction of the commercial SMD packages used in these tests, however, resulted in a degradation of the device performance starting at about 600°C. An identification (ID) tag on La3Ga5SiO14, could be used as a wireless passive thermometer for measuring high temperatures in industrial process control applications.},

It is well known that the voltage amplitude from low-profile piezocerarnic sensors used for inspection may change not only due to damage but also due to an inappropriate transducer coupling and temperature effects. The paper studies the effect of temperature on Lamb wave responses. The work involves a simple experiment in which two piezoelectric ceramics are bonded on an aluminium plate. The plate is exposed to various levels of temperature. A couple of simple features extracted from the Lamb wave responses are analysed to show the effect of the temperature changes. The plate was later subjected to damage and the series of tests and analysis repeated in order to give some comparison between the effects of damage and temperature change upon the responses. Several ways of how this problem can be circumvented using appropriate signal processing techniques are discussed.},

abstract = {The present two-part work deals with a detailed characterization of the flow field and heat transfer distribution in a model of a rotating ribbed channel performed in a novel setup which allows test conditions at high rotation numbers (Ro). The tested model is mounted on a rotating frame with all the required instrumentation, resulting in a high spatial resolution and accuracy. The channel has a cross section with an aspect ratio of 0.9 and a ribbed wall with eight ribs perpendicular to the main flow direction. The blockage of the ribs is 10{\%} of the channel cross section, whereas the rib pitch-to-height ratio is 10. In this second part of the study, the heat transfer distribution over the wall region between the sixth and seventh ribs is obtained by means of liquid crystal thermography (LCT). Tests were first carried out at a Reynolds number of 15,000 and a maximum Ro of 1.00 to evaluate the evolution of the heat transfer with increasing rotation. On the trailing side (TS), the overall Nusselt number increases with rotation until a limit value of 50{\%} higher than in the static case, which is achieved after a value of the rotation number of about 0.3. On the leading side (LS), the overall Nusselt number decreases with increasing rotation speed to reach a minimum which is approximately 50{\%} of the one found in static conditions. The velocity measurements at Re=15,000 and Ro=0.77 provided in Part I of this paper are finally merged to provide a consistent explanation of the heat transfer distribution in this model. Moreover, heat transfer measurements were performed at Reynolds numbers of 30,000 and 55,000, showing approximately the same trend.},

This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

abstract = {To understand the stress evolution and failure mechanisms of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs), finite element simulations are an invaluable tool. Simulations are especially useful to unwrap complex interactions of different phenomena at high temperature, including creep, sintering, diffusion, and oxidation. However, the correct setup and evaluation of a finite element model for this problem are difficult. This article reviews critical issues in modelling TBC systems. Some of the most important aspects are as follows: (a) stresses in 3D simulations may differ considerably from 2D models; (b) the interface shape strongly affects the stresses and using an idealized geometry may underestimate stresses; (c) crack propagation requires simulating sufficiently large regions to correctly capture stress redistribution; (d) a correct description of the material behaviour (visco-plasticity, TGO growth, sintering) is crucial in determining the stress state. The article discusses these and other issues in detail and provides guidelines on the choice of model parameters, boundary conditions, etc. The paper also points out open questions in modelling TBC systems and discusses aspects of verification and validation.},

Results for the damping coefficient and Young's modulus have been obtained for several high temperature alloys (FeCrAlY and a single crystal, Ni-based superalloy PWA 1484), ceramics (polycrystalline alumina and yttria-stabilized zirconia) and an electron-beam deposited thermal barrier coating. The results indicate that the thermally grown oxide, formed by high-temperature oxidation does not confer significant damping, whereas, coatings of the yttria-stabilized zirconia produce measurable damping over the entire temperature range with a peak centered at ∼200 °C. The damping peak appears to be an intrinsic property of the YSZ material whether in the form of a bulk material or a metastable coating. Data on the temperature dependent in-plane Young's modulus of the 7 wt.{\%} yttria-stabilized zirconia thermal barrier coating between room temperature (22 GPa) and 900 °C (18 GPa) is also reported for the first time. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The strain tolerance of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) used in gas turbine engines is enhanced by incorporation of through-thickness pores within the coating. However, molten calcium-magnesium-alumino-silicate (CMAS) deposits are then able to permeate through the interconnected pore network resulting in dissolution of the coating in the silicate melt, precipitation of new phases, and the elimination of the pores needed for strain tolerance when silicate melt solidification occurs upon cooling. Here we used an electron beam directed vapor deposition method to deposit strain tolerant coatings containing a high volume fraction of inter-columnar pores to assess the effect of increasing the pore volume fraction upon silicate melt infiltration in a 7wt.{\%} yttria stabilized zirconia (7YSZ) TBC. We then explore two potential mitigation approaches. One investigated the infiltration of a samarium zirconate (SZO) coating deposited on a 7wt.{\%} yttria stabilized zirconia (7YSZ) buffer layer since recent work has indicated the related gadolinium zirconate (GZO) system was much more CMAS resistant than 7YSZ. The second explored the effects of an embedded platinum layer located near the outer surface of the SZO layer. The response of both systems to attack by a model 33CaO-9MgO-13AlO1.5-45SiO2 CMAS melt at 1250°C has been compared to that of the 7YSZ composition coating deposited by the same process. The 7YSZ specimens were fully infiltrated by CMAS in less than 1min and significantly dissolved and re-precipitated a globular phase after 4h of exposure. The penetration rate in SZO coatings was reduced by about a factor of five, but the coatings were still completely penetrated after a 4hour exposure. Significant SZO dissolution and precipitation of both globular fluorite and faceted apatite phases were observed after the 4h of exposure, with concomitant debonding at the SZO/YSZ interface. The insertion of a 5$\mu$m thick Pt layer about 30$\mu$m below the SZO surface arrested permeation of CMAS for about 16h and might provide a promising strategy for controlling CMAS degradation in TBCs without reducing the thermo-cyclic delamination resistance. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {There are on-going efforts to utilize guided waves for structural damage detection. Active sensing devices such as lead zirconate titanate (PZT) have been widely used for guided wave generation and sensing. In addition, there has been increasing interest in adopting wireless sensing to structural health monitoring (SHM) applications. One of major challenges in wireless SHM is to secure power necessary to operate the wireless sensors. However, because active sensing devices demand relatively high electric power compared to conventional passive sensors such as accelerometers and strain gauges, existing battery technologies may not be suitable for long-term operation of the active sensing devices. To tackle this problem, a new wireless power transmission paradigm has been developed in this study. The proposed technique wirelessly transmits power necessary for PZT-based guided wave generation using laser and optoelectronic devices. First, a desired waveform is generated and the intensity of the laser source is modulated accordingly using an electro-optic modulator (EOM). Next, the modulated laser is wirelessly transmitted to a photodiode connected to a PZT. Then, the photodiode converts the transmitted light into an electric signal and excites the PZT to generate guided waves on the structure where the PZT is attached to. Finally, the corresponding response from the sensing PZT is measured. The feasibility of the proposed method for wireless guided wave generation has been experimentally demonstrated.},

Therefore the indents were performed on cross-sections and on the coatings' surface itself. Because of the expected different behavior at the grain boundaries and the grains, the measurement locations were randomly chosen. The measured property was the Young's modulus. For a better interpretation, the measurement results were described by the method of Weibull distribution. The measured values showed a significant dependency with the substrate temperature and a low dependency with oxygen partial pressure during the deposition process.

abstract = {                    Environmental requirements to reduce CO                    2                    emissions and the drive towards higher efficiencies have resulted in increased operating temperatures in gas turbines. Subsequently, Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEMs) require improved component design and material selection to withstand the harsher conditions. This demands rapid evaluation of new components and their surface temperature to accelerate their market entry. Accurate temperature information proves key in the design of more efficient, longer-lasting machinery and in monitoring thermal damage. A number of traditional temperature measurement techniques are available, but can incur a number of limitations. Online temperature measurements, such as pyrometry or phosphor thermography, often require optical access to the component during operation and are therefore not suitable for inaccessible components. Other options including thermocouples can only provide point measurements and cannot deliver profiles across the surface. Offline techniques store temperature information that can be measured and analysed following operation. Several of these, however, are of destructive nature, can affect local thermal gradients and only provide point measurements. This article discusses an innovative offline measurement technique: luminescent Thermal History Paints (THPs). THPs are comprised of ceramic pigments in a binder matrix that can be applied to any hot component as a thin coating. These pigments are doped with optically active ions, which will phosphoresce when excited with a light source. The coating material experiences irreversible structural changes depending on the temperature it is exposed to. Changes in the material structure are reflected in its phosphorescent properties, which are measured with standard optical instrumentation at any surface location. Since the changes are permanent, the temperature information is stored in the coating and can be extracted after operation. Following calibration, it is therefore possible to relate phosphorescent behaviour to the past maximum temperature experienced at each location. This is done with Sensor Coating Systems Ltd. (SCS)'s portable instrumentation, which can provide rapid, automated and objective measurements across a component surface. Unlike the more traditional thermal paints, THPs are non-toxic, and provide a continuous measurement capability across the range 150°C–900°C with significantly improved durability. This article describes the underlying principles behind this novel technology and the advantages it provides over existing state-of-the-art methods. The benefits will be demonstrated through measurements on nozzle guide vanes (NGVs), with the view to compare and validate them against thermocouple measurements. The results show that the THP extends the limited information from thermocouples to provide a more complete view of the thermal processes on the component.                  },

In this paper, thermistor and thermal couple devices were in-situ fabricated directly on nozzle guide vane surface. High temperature characterization and various tough vibration-and shocking test were performed on these embedded sensors. The sensor system (including sensor and the wiring) is capable of measuring up to 1200°C high temperature and standing for up to 40g 10-2000Hz vibration and 100g shocking test. These embedded sensors also survived hot gas turbine test with pressure gas flow of 1200°C/ 0.5MPa and exhibits reliable temperature readings. This development is very useful to quantify the temperature on the sensitive spot of turbine components for aero engine R{\&}D purpose and for monitoring the temperature in combustion chamber and turbine areas. These thin film sensors are within one $\mu$m thick with line-width within a few hundred $\mu$m therefore bring about minimum turbulence to the environmental gas flows.},

This study was accompanied by simulations aimed at identification of material parameters for two different constitutive material models. Experimental flow curves obtained for PMMA were used in elasto-plastic analysis, while a sim-flow optimization tool was employed for a two-layer viscoplasticity model. The temperature increase significantly affected mechanical behaviour of PMMA, with quasi-brittle fracture at room temperature and super-plastic behaviour ($\epsilon${\textgreater}110{\%}) at 80 °C. The two-layer viscoplasticity material model was found to agree better with the experimental data obtained for uniaxial tension than the elasto-plastic description.},

The MASW (Mutichannel analysis of surface waves) is then employed for data processing making explicit the presence and character of the lamb different propagation modes. The curves are then interpreted. The link between MATLAB and COMSOL for transforming the simulation in interpretable curves is very convenient for routine comparison between numerical and analytical or experimental solutions.},

abstract = {Surface acoustic waves (SAW) have been studied for more than 50 years and are mainly used as frequency filters. Using appropriate design considerations, these devices are sensitive to external conditions including temperature, pressure, strain or chemical/biological mass loading: hence, SAW sensors are implemented and provide unique characteristics [1]. Amongst the original characteristics, the linear behavior of the piezoelectric substrates provides interrogation ranges hardly achieved with silicon-based radiofrequency devices, extreme working temperatures and simple manufacturing conditions with a single cleanroom process step: hence, SAW transducers provide ideal transducers for passive sensors interrogated through a radiofrequency wireless link. This work is devoted to the development of a wireless interrogation system able to operate under high temperature environments (650 to 900°C for the sensors). As wireless passive SAW-based sensors are considered here, the sensor reading allows the interrogation unit (so-called reader) to be far enough (some meters) to avoid facing such temperature conditions. However, the reader must be able to operate at temperatures in the 100-150deg;C range, beyond the usual industrial grade integrated circuit characteristics. Therefore, the capability of the reader to operate under such conditions and hence to meet the above specifications is considered. The sensor and the interrogation unit are here both submitted to "high" temperature environments, with different meaning whether passive surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors or reader including CMOS and radio-frequency (RF) components are considered. We qualify the maximum operating temperature of our reader designed using commercial off the shelf (COTS) components with standard temperature requirements. The reader is tested from room temperature up to failure, which is met around 140°C. The cause of the failure is due to a communication chip (RS232-USB converter): the whole interrogation unit is thus expected to reach even higher temperatures without significant performance losses. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Thermal barrier coating (TBC) is an important material for aero-engine as a good thermal and electrical insulator. However this ceramic layer becomes electrically conductive at elevated temperatures above 600°C. By making use of its thermal resistance sensitivity to ambient temperature a smart thermal sensor can also be formulated to monitor the surface temperature on aero-engine turbine blade. In this paper the fabrication of this new sensor is reported together with comprehensive high-temperature characterizations such as repeatability, responsiveness and measurement error evaluation under various high temperature cycling and aero-engine onsite combustion test. Results show this sensor is capable to test the surface temperature in 500-1 000°C range or higher. YSZ-based (yttria-stabilized zirconia) TBC thermistor sensor shows a reliable and repeatable resistor vs temperature behavior and comparable responsiveness as conventional thermalcouple device with the measurement errors in 3{\%}. Sensor fabrication is fairly simpels just involving a platinum soldering on TBC surface for wiring connection to outside meters. A new test array based on the YSZ thermal resistor is proposed as a temperature distribution monitor and verified by the aid of thermal-electrical interactive simulations. This simple methodology can be used for quick checking of surface temperature on turbine guide vane used in combustion chamber and other relevant parts.},

abstract = {Optical fibre sensors are being investigated since many years as candidates of choice for supporting structural health monitoring (SHM) in aerospace applications. Fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, more specifically, can provide for accurate strain measurements and therefore return useful data about the mechanical strain state of the structure to which they are attached. This functionality can serve the detection of damage in an aircraft structure. However, very few solutions for protecting and bonding optical fibres to a state-of-the-art aircraft composite material have been reported. Most proof-of-principle demonstrations using optical fibre sensors for aerospace SHM-related applications reported in literature indeed rely on unpackaged fibre sensors bonded to isotropic metallic surfaces in a mostly unspecified manner. Neither the operation of the sensor, nor the adhesive material and bonding procedure are tested for their endurance against a full set of standardized in-flight conditions. In this work we propose a specialty coated FBG sensor and its permanent installation on aerospace-grade composite materials, and we demonstrate the compatibility with aerospace in-flight conditions. To do so we thoroughly evaluate the quality of the operation of the FBG sensor by correlating the reflection spectra of the installed sensors before and after exposure to a full set of realistic in-flight conditions. We also evaluate the difference in strain measured by the FBG, since any damage in the adhesive bond line would lead to strain release. The applied test conditions are based on aerospace standards and include temperature cycling, pressure cycling, exposure to humidity and hydraulic fluid and fatigue loading. We show that both the bond line and the quality of the sensor signal were negligibly affected by the applied environmental and mechanical loads representing in-flight conditions and therefore conclude that it can be considered for SHM of aerospace-grade composite materials.},

abstract = {Condition monitoring of gas pipes has been an important issue for gas companies. Failure to accurately identify condition of gas pipes result in numerous problems. Also, producing a condition monitoring system for buried pipelines is challenging. Small pipes (with diameters less than 50 mm) are considered here as most of the literature focuses on larger pipes. Guided wave theory will be introduced alongside a numerical simulation of the relevant dispersion curves of the system. This paper investigates the feasibility of using torsional guided waves for inspecting defects in buried pipes with small diameters. The pipes are assumed to be lossless and hence the effect of attenuation is ignored in the calculations. Upon finding the theoretical guided wave characteristics, experiments were conducted to see if the aim could be achieved in a realistic scenario. A steel pipe with a diameter of 34 mm and wall thickness of 5.5 mm is considered. High reverberation levels at high frequency propagations due to mode conversion are studied. Having only a limited number of transducers could be a reason for high reverberation at high frequencies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Chinese Automation and Computing Society in the UK - CACS.},

This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

abstract = {Heat transfer and aerodynamic measurements have been made on the endwalls of an annular cascade of turbine nozzle guide vanes in the presence of film cooling. The results indicate that high levels of cooling effectiveness can be achieved on the endwalls of turbine nozzle guide vanes (NGV). The NGV were operated at the correct engine nondimensional conditions of Reynolds number, Mach number, gasto- wall temperature ratio, and gas-to-coolant density ratio. The results show that the secondary flow and horseshoe vortex act on the coolant, which is convected toward the suction side of the NG V endwall passage. Consequently the coolant does not quite reach the pressure side/casing trailing edge, leading to diminished cooling in this region. Increasing the blowing rate from 0.52 to 1.1 results in significant reductions in heat transfer to the endwall. Similar trends are evident when the coolant temperature is reduced. Measured heat transfer rates indicate that over most of the endwall region the film cooling reduces the Nusselt number by 50 to 75 percent. {\textcopyright} 1992 by ASME.},

abstract = {Aircraft smart skin technology requires the integration of large-scale, lightweight, and integrative sensor networks with aircraft structural skin, but it is difficult to directly manufacture such sensor networks in a large-scale, low-cost, reliable, and simple way. To study this issue, a design and manufacturing method of a stretchable and large-scale guided wave sensor network is proposed in this article. The key principle of the method is to design and manufacture the guided wave sensor network in a limited scale and expand it in a large-scale for aircraft smart skin of structural health monitoring. To ensure the excellent stretchability of the network, the design method of a serpentine-based fractal island-interconnect structure combined with the flexible printed circuit manufacturing process is proposed. The whole manufacturing process of the guided wave sensor network is realized by the mature flexible printed circuit process and the piezoelectric transducers (referred to as PZTs) are integrated with the network by reflow soldering which is compatible with the flexible printed circuit process, which greatly reduce manufacturing costs, simplify manufacturing process, and improve the yield and stability of the network. The guided wave sensor network can be uniaxially stretched to 500{\%} of its original size and work well when fully expanded to cover 2500{\%} of its original area. The test results of guided wave response show that the PZTs on the network can excite and receive guided wave signal normally. In addition, the network is placed on the surface of a carbon fiber composite laminate with stiffeners and the validation results show that the network can be applied to both active and passive guided wave–based structural health monitoring of composite structures, including damage imaging and impact imaging.},

The CSNP-PDMS composite has been investigated as the functional patch for its laser energy absorption efficiency, fast thermal diffusion, and large thermoelastic expansion capabilities. The signal amplitude (in mW) from the CSNP-PDMS patch exhibits 2.3 times higher amplitude than the no patch condition and a narrower bandwidth than other conditions. Furthermore, improvement in the sensitivity is also achieved through the selection of the aluminum nitride sensing system. The overall combination of the Lamb wave generation and receiver-sensing system in this study is found to be very promising for a broad range of noncontact NDT{\&}E applications.},

A model is proposed to account for all relevant temperature-dependent parameters of a pitch-catch system on an isotropic plate, including the actuator-plate and plate-sensor interactions through shear-lag behavior, the piezoelectric and dielectric permittivity properties of the transducers, and the Lamb wave dispersion properties of the substrate plate. The model is used to predict the S0 and A0 response spectra in aluminum plates for the temperature range of -40-+60°C, which accounts for normal aircraft operations. The transducers examined are monolithic PZT-5A [PZT denotes Pb (Zr-Ti) O3] patches and flexible macrofiber composite type P1 patches. The study shows substantial changes in Lamb wave amplitude response caused solely by temperature excursions. It is also shown that, for the transducers considered, the response amplitude changes follow two opposite trends below and above ambient temperature (20°C), respectively. These results can provide a basis for the compensation of temperature effects in guided-wave damage detection systems. {\textcopyright} 2008 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract = {Novel surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices using the recent langasite (LGS) family of crystals have been designed, fabricated, and tested for high temperature (up to 750°C) gas sensor applications. The devices were fabricated using platinum (Pt) and palladium (Pd) thin film technology as electrodes and sensing films to withstand temperatures in excess of 1000°C. Combinations of platinum and platinum/tungsten trioxide (Pt/WO3) films have been used in the detection of C2H4 in N 2 (C2H4/N2). Original all palladium metallic structures have been employed in the detection of H2 in a N2 carrier gas (H2/N2). SAW resonator structures using these films have been fabricated and continuously cycled from 250 to 750°C for periods up to 3 weeks, with degradations in the |S 21| response up to 7 dB. Constantly held at 250°C for 12 weeks, the maximum degradation in the |S21| observed dropped to 3 dB. In order to perform the required gas testing, a high temperature, air sealed, stainless steel, dual chamber has been designed and fabricated to house these devices. The two-port SAW resonator structures fabricated with Pt, Pt/WO 3, and the original all-Pd films mentioned above have been tested with exposures to H2/N2 and C2H 4/N2 in the temperature range of 250-450°C. Frequency variations up to 10 kHz for the 167 MHz high temperature SAW sensors were measured. The high temperature LGS SAW devices and experiments reported in this work show the capability of these devices to withstand prolonged exposure to temperatures ranging from 250 to 750°C and to perform as high temperature gas sensors. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Thermal barrier coatings are used to reduce the actual working temperature of the high pressure turbine blade metal surface and; hence permit the engine to operate at higher more efficient temperatures. Sensor coatings are an adaptation of existing thermal barrier coatings to enhance their functionality, such that they not only protect engine components from the high temperature gas, but can also measure the material temperature accurately and determine the health of the coating e.g., ageing, erosion and corrosion. The sensing capability is introduced by embedding optically active materials into the thermal barrier coatings and by illuminating these coatings with excitation light phosphorescence can be observed. The phosphorescence carries temperature and structural information about the coating. Accurate temperature measurements in the engine hot section would eliminate some of the conservative margins which currently need to be imposed to permit safe operation. A 50 K underestimation at high operating temperatures can lead to significant premature failure of the protective coating and loss of integrity. Knowledge of the exact temperature could enable the adaptation of the most efficient coating strategies using the minimum amount of air. The integration of an on-line temperature detection system would enable the full potential of thermal barrier coatings to be realized due to improved accuracy in temperature measurement and early warning of degradation. This, in turn, will increase fuel efficiency and reduce CO 2 emissions. Application: This paper describes the implementation of a sensor coating system on a Rolls-Royce jet engine. The system consists of three components: industrially manufactured robust coatings, advanced remote detection optics and improved control and readout software. The majority of coatings were based on yttria stabilized zirconia doped with Dy (dysprosium) and Eu (europium), although other coatings made of yttrium aluminum garnet were manufactured as well. Coatings were produced on a production line using atmospheric plasma spraying. Parallel tests at Didcot power station revealed survivability of specific coatings in excess of 4500 effective operating hours. It is deduced that the capability of these coatings is in the range of normal maintenance schedules of industrial gas turbines of 24,000 h or even longer. An advanced optical system was designed and manufactured permitting easy scanning of coated components and also the detection of phosphorescence on rotating turbine blades (13 k rotations per minute) at stand-off distances of up to 400 mm. Successful temperature measurements were taken from the nozzle guide vanes (hot), the combustion chamber (noisy) and the rotating turbine blades (moving) and compared with thermocouple and pyrometer installations for validation purposes. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

The sensor detailed is fabricated on AT-X quartz, packaged using an off the shelf Kovar package, and instrumented with commercially available strain gauge adhesives. The sensor is initially presented on a characterised strain calibration platform developed in TCD with a foil strain gauge as reference technology for performance validation and comparison.

The tool holder coupled with the integrated SAW strain measurement technology is calibrated using a Kistler Dynamometer in an Instron loading machine. The fully calibrated sensor is a platform for dynamic tool condition monitoring in a commercial CNC machine is then described.

abstract = {Surface acoustic waves (SAW) have been studied for more than 50 years and are mainly used as frequency filters. Using appropriate design considerations, these devices are sensitive to external conditions including temperature, pressure, strain or chemical/biological mass loading: hence, SAW sensors are implemented and provide unique characteristics [1]. Amongst the original characteristics, the linear behavior of the piezoelectric substrates provides interrogation ranges hardly achieved with silicon-based radiofrequency devices, extreme working temperatures and simple manufacturing conditions with a single cleanroom process step: hence, SAW transducers provide ideal transducers for passive sensors interrogated through a radiofrequency wireless link. This work is devoted to the development of a wireless interrogation system able to operate under high temperature environments (650 to 900°C for the sensors). As wireless passive SAW-based sensors are considered here, the sensor reading allows the interrogation unit (so-called reader) to be far enough (some meters) to avoid facing such temperature conditions. However, the reader must be able to operate at temperatures in the 100-150deg;C range, beyond the usual industrial grade integrated circuit characteristics. Therefore, the capability of the reader to operate under such conditions and hence to meet the above specifications is considered. The sensor and the interrogation unit are here both submitted to "high" temperature environments, with different meaning whether passive surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors or reader including CMOS and radio-frequency (RF) components are considered. We qualify the maximum operating temperature of our reader designed using commercial off the shelf (COTS) components with standard temperature requirements. The reader is tested from room temperature up to failure, which is met around 140°C. The cause of the failure is due to a communication chip (RS232-USB converter): the whole interrogation unit is thus expected to reach even higher temperatures without significant performance losses. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Cirtautas2022,
abstract = {Hidden corrosion defects can lead to dangerous accidents such as leakage of toxic materials causing extreme environmental and economic consequences. Ultrasonic guided waves showed good potential detecting distributed corrosion in pipeline networks at sufficiently large distances. To sim-plify signal analysis, traditional guided wave methods use low frequencies where only fundamental modes exist; hence, the small, localized defects are usually barely detectable. Novel techniques frequently use higher order guided wave modes that propagate around the circumference of the pipe and are more sensitive to the localized changes in the wall thickness. However current high order mode guided wave technology commonly uses either non-dispersive shear modes or higher order mode cluster (HOMC) waves that are mostly sensitive to surface defects. As the number of application cases of high order modes to corrosion detection is still limited, a huge potential is available to seek for other modes that can offer improved resolution and sensitivity to localized corrosion type defects. The objective of this work was to investigate higher order modes for corrosion detection and to determine the most promising ones in sense of excitability, leakage losses, propagation distance, and potential simplicity in the analysis. The selection of the proper mode is discussed with the support of phase and group velocity dispersion curves, out of plane and in plane distributions over the thickness and on surface of the sample, and leakage losses due to water load. The analysis led to selection of symmetric S3 mode, while the excitation of it was demonstrated through finite element simulations, taking into account the size of phased array aperture and apodization law and considering two-sided mode generation. Finally, theoretical estimations were confirmed with experiments, demonstrating the ability to generate and receive selected mode. It was shown that S3 mode is a good candidate for corrosion screening around the circumference of the pipe, as it has sufficient propagation distance, can be generated with conventional ultrasonic (UT) phased arrays, has sufficiently high group velocity to be distinguished from co-existing modes, and is sensitive to the loss of wall thickness.},

It was found that the vane crack initiation and propagation was drived by thermal fatigue mechanism. The vane crack initiation and propagation were due to fatigue mechanism which was facilitated by grain boundaries brittleness caused by formation of continuous film of carbides on grain boundaries, grains coarsening, and high thermal stress level. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

These "thermographie phosphors," e.g., Y2O3:Eu, have been used for remote measurements of the temperatures of both static and moving surfaces, and have performed many other tasks that standard sensors (thermocouples, thermistors, etc.) cannot. The range of usefulness of this class of materials extends from cryogenic temperatures to those approaching 2000 °C. The instrumentation needed for this type of thermometry has followed many different lines of development, and this evolution has produced a wide variety of both field- and laboratory-grade systems that are now described in the literature. In general, the technique offers high sensitivity (≈0.05 °C), robustness (e.g., stability of the sensor sample in harsh environments), and NIST traceability. In addition, such systems have been successfully adapted to make remotely sensed measurements of pressure, heat flux, shear stress, and strain. In this review, we summarize the physical mechanisms that form the basis for the technique, and then catalog and discuss the instrumentation-related aspects of several different remote thermometry systems that employ thermographic phosphors as the sensors. {\textcopyright} 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The early detection of failures in structures is a subject of great interest in engineering; several of these techniques are linked with the elastic wave propagation, using guided waves is one of these alternatives. Several structures of interest in engineering are laminar arrangements; the wave propagation in this type of structures depends not only on the material properties, but also on the geometric parameters, such as the plate thickness. Tubular structures, pressure vessels, tanks and also parts of ships hulls could be considered laminar. The elastic wave propagation in laminar structures could be considered as a sum of modal shapes that have its wave length and frequencies defined. These mode families are characteristics of each structure and could be represented through the dispersion curves. The definition of these dispersion curves is of crucial importance to understand the propagation of guided waves in the structure studied. In the present work the dispersion curves were generated using three different methodologies, specific for metallic rectangular stems that compound the strengthening armor in flexible riser duct. Each approach presented in the analysis were carried out using standard finite element commercial packages and an experimental verification, as well. The premise is to present the topics in the simplest way, not only to understand how the dispersion curves are built but also how these curves must be interpreted.},

abstract = {Remote-temperature sensing using thermal phosphors is being developed as a nonintrusive technique for monitoring and analyzing the high-temperature, highly corrosive environments of turbomachinery. Proof-ofprinciple tests were conducted on phosphor-coated turbine blades that were rotating at low speeds and were immersed in a jet fuel flame. A pulsed nitrogen laser produced fluorescence from the applied phosphor. A simple optical scheme collected this emission, and a digital oscilloscope extracted from the signal the temperature-dependent decay rate. Measured temperatures ranged from 700-1000°C. These were comparable with values indicated by a pyrometer. Time-dependent temperature measurements demonstrated the transient capabilities of the thermophosphor technique. This is only the second time the phosphor technique has been implemented in a flame environment. The previous work involved a water-cooled object near 150°C. The current test was at a much higher temperature and incorporated a rotating object as well. The data provide important information for designing a thermophosphor system for future real-engine testing. {\textcopyright} 1990 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., All rights reserved.},

Recently new surface modification techniques have been developed such as plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD), electrostatic spray assisted vapour deposition (ESAVD), and solution precursor plasma spray (SPPS), sol-gel and suspension plasma spraying (SPS). These processes enhance the features of developed coatings which include the formation of vertical cracks by utilizing segmentation process and so on.

abstract = {This paper presents two different numerical methods to predict the thermal load of a convection-cooled gas-Turbine blade under realistic operating temperature conditions. The subject of the investigation is a gas-Turbine rotor blade equipped with an academic convection-cooling system and investigated at a cascade test-rig. It consists of three cooling channels, which are connected outside the blade, so allowing cooling air temperature measurements. Both methods use FE models to obtain the temperature distribution of the solid blade. The difference between these methods lies in the generation of the heat transfer coefficients along the cooling channel walls which serve as a boundary condition for the FE model. One method, referred to as the FEM1D method, uses empirical one-dimensional correlations known from the available literature. The other method, the FEM2D method, uses three-dimensional CFD simulations to obtain two-dimensional heat transfer coefficient distributions. The numerical results are compared to each other as well as to experimental data, so that the benefits and limitations of each method can be shown and validated. Overall, this paper provides an evaluation of the different methods which are used to predict temperature distributions in convection-cooled gas-Turbines with regard to accuracy, numerical cost and the limitations of each method. The temperature profiles obtained in all methods generally show good agreement with the experiments. However, the more detailed methods produce more accurate results by causing higher numerical costs.},

Piezoelectric fiber patches (PFPs) are known as lightweight and structure-conforming transducers for guided elastic wave generation and detection. We propose a new PFP concept combining advantages of different previous designs. With the new approach, a user can switch between a Lamb wave and a shear horizontal wave excitation by partially changing the polarity of the transducer electrodes.

abstract = {Existing thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) can be adapted enhancing their functionalities such that they not only protect critical components from hot gases, but also can sense their own material temperature or other physical properties. The self-sensing capability is introduced by embedding optically active rare earth ions into the thermal barrier ceramic. When illuminated by light the material starts to phosphoresce and the phosphorescence can provide in-situ information on temperature, phase changes, corrosion or erosion of the coating subject to the coating design. Quantitative measures of the degradation can be collected by non-destructive means such that the deterioration could be monitored. The results from different applications of the technology illustrate how the techniques could be used to gather information to move towards predictive maintenance routines. In addition, sensor TBCs can be employed to conduct temperature measurements either during operation or off-line to optimise operating conditions and reliably move to more efficient engine operation. Temperature measurements have been demonstrated during operation of a gas turbine. Furthermore, coatings have been installed in a UK power station and the profile of the luminescence decay time indicates the operating temperature map which corroborated with micrograph analysis.},

abstract = {Lamb waves have proven to be a valuable tool for structural health monitoring (SHM) of plate-like structures susceptible to degradation and failure. It is well-known that their multi-modal propagation characteristic could be both a challenge and an opportunity. Piezoelectric transducers are widely used in SHM applications because of their low cost, small profile and high electromechanical coupling. Properly designing a piezoelectric transducer to excite a particular mode is of great importance to successful SHM practice. Mode tuning capability of piezoelectric transducers has been studied both theoretically and experimentally in the literature for exciting A0 and S0 modes. However, the higher order Lamb waves are not fully studied for their tuning capability. Also, the transducer is usually modeled separately from the waveguide and their coupling is through the in-plane surface traction. This assumption may induce inaccuracy if the dynamics of the actuator are not negligible. Additionally, the driving circuit is not usually included in the current actuator-waveguide models such that the power of excited wave could not be evaluated. In this work, a fully coupled finite element model created for general Lamb wave excitation using piezoelectric transducers is developed. The model comprises three components, electrical driving circuit, piezoelectric element and linear elastic waveguide. The preferential excitation of higher order Lamb wave modes using a single piezoelectric element has been studied and demonstrated experimentally on aluminum plates.},

A signal processing technique is presented that enables this constraint on operating point to be relaxed. The technique makes use of a priori knowledge of the dispersion characteristics of a guided wave mode to map signals from the time to distance domains. In the mapping process, dispersed signals are compressed to their original shape. The theoretical basis of the technique is described and an efficient numerical implementation is presented. The robustness of the technique to inaccuracies in the dispersion data is also addressed. The application of the technique to experimental data is shown and the resulting improvement in spatial resolution is demonstrated.

To determine the cause of damage, evaluations including visual inspections, microstructural investigations, and finite element method (FEM) analyses were carried out on the damaged nozzle. The microstructural investigations were performed through evaluation of the microstructure near the damaged area using optical and scanning electron microscopes. The FEM analyses performed to determine the temperature and stress distribution at different points of the nozzle. The results of visual inspections and microscopic investigations revealed the signs of microstructural degradations and hot corrosion near some of the cracks on the trailing edge of the NGVs. The results of the FEM analyses showed that due to the temperature gradient, thermal stresses are arisen in the nozzle components and caused thermal fatigue occurrence. Based on the analyses, it was concluded that the thermal fatigue is the dominant mechanism for premature damage of the second stage nozzle guide vanes of the gas turbine. Moreover, the simultaneous occurrence of microstructural degradations and hot corrosion on the NGVs, has a supplementary effect on the propagation of the cracks in addition to thermal fatigue.},

This degradation can lead to catastrophic failure of engineering components; consequently, knowledge of the thermal history of a component is crucial to predicting the degradation of properties and anticipating/preventing failures. In this work, a thermal history sensor capable of operating wirelessly in severe environments has been developed which functions as much more than a thermal fuse, but less than a computer-monitored thermocouple. The sensor utilizes the thermally activated crystallization of glass-ceramics to record a thermal history fingerprint in an array of glass-ceramic substrates. Computer modeling as well as experimental results are presented as proof of concept for the sensor. Degradation state sensing as well as the effects of environmental moisture on the operation of the sensor will also be discussed. The end product will employ a pattern-matching algorithm to characterize instantly the thermal exposure by comparing to a database of thermal history fingerprints.

This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

abstract = {Guided wave-based inspection has emerged as a promising tool to evaluate the reliability of key components in modern industries. The fundamental shear horizontal (SH0) wave is always of great interests for plate-like structures because of its non-dispersion characteristics. However, the generation and reception of SH0 wave using piezoelectric wafers is not straightforward. In this paper, we firstly define three types shear mode piezoelectric wafers, i.e., the conventional in-plane poled thickness-shear (d15) mode, the thickness-poled thickness-shear (d15) mode, and the face-shear (d24) mode. Then, finite element simulations were conducted to demonstrate their performance in SH wave generation and reception. The results indicated that the face shear d24 wafer can generate almost single mode SH0 wave, while both types of d15 wafers would generate Lamb waves and SH0 wave simultaneously. Finally, experiments were carried out to check the efficiency of different shear mode piezoelectric wafers in SH0 wave generation and reception. The results indicated that the d24 wafer can generate and receive SH0 wave of high signal to noise ratio (SNR) with high energy conversion efficiency, while the in-plane poled d15 wafer would generate SH0 wave of high amplitude and acceptable SNR but with relatively low energy conversion efficiency. The performances of thickness-poled d15 wafer was not as good as the other two in both SH wave generation and reception. This work will be helpful for the applications of SH waves in plate-like structures.},

Turbine blades experience very critical environments inside a gas turbine. They are subjected to very high temperatures, high stresses, and high levels of vibration. All these factors can lead to blade failures, potentially destroying the engine; therefore, turbine blades have to be carefully designed for making possible its use in higher operating temperatures, and thereby extending its life, reducing the life cycle cost, increasing environmental resistance and in some cases even reduce the noxious exhaust emissions.

abstract = {A combined experimental and analytical investigation has been performed to understand the mechanical behavior of two amorphous polymers-polycarbonate and poly(methyl methacrylate)-at strain rates ranging from 10-4 to 104 s-1. This range in strain rates was achieved in uniaxial tension and compression tests using a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA), a servo-hydraulic testing machine, and an aluminum split-Hopkinson pressure bar. DMA tension tests were used to characterize the viscoelastic behavior of these materials, with focus on the rate-dependent shift of material transition temperatures. Uniaxial compression tests on the servo-hydraulic machine (10-4 to 1 s-1) and the split-Hopkinson pressure bar (103 to 104 s-1) were used to characterize the rate-dependent yield and post-yield behavior. Both materials were observed to exhibit increased rate sensitivity of yield under the same strain rate/temperature conditions as the $\beta$-transition of the viscoelastic behavior. A physically based constitutive model for large strain deformation of thermoplastics was then extended to encompass high-rate conditions. The model accounts for the contributions of different molecular motions which become operational and important in different frequency regimes. The new features enable the model to not only capture the transition in the yield behavior, but also accurately predict the post-yield, large strain behavior over a wide range of temperatures and strain rates. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, understanding the underlying degradation and failure mechanisms of TBCs is significant to assess and further enhance the durability and reliability of TBCs. Regarding the durability of TBCs, this paper reviews different failures mechanisms of TBCs caused by residual stresses, phase transformations, sintering, hot corrosion attack and oxidation. Subsequently, some methods are summarized to alleviate the undesirable effects of the causes, so as to extend the lifetime of TBCs. Regarding the thermal barrier performance of TBCs, the neoteric advances to resist degradation in thermal conductivity of TBCs are reviewed. In addition, some new ceramic materials with superior intrinsic properties are introduced for ultra-high temperature applications. In brief, this review correlates the microstructure and properties of TBCs for finer interpretation and degradation-resistant design on their thermal and mechanical properties, which would benefit the advanced TBCs in future engineering applications.},

It addresses fundamentals such as the mechanisms of Lamb wave activation, propagation and acquisition, the selection of transducers and design of active sensor networks, and the development of signal processing for de-noising, compression and feature extraction in the time, frequency and joint time-frequency domains. It also provides detailed descriptions of various signal fusion algorithms for the quantitative determination of damage parameters location, orientation, size and severity. Other key topics include: finite element modelling and experimental techniques for Lamb waves; active sensor network technology using various agents, e.g., piezoelectric actuator/sensor and fibre Bragg grating sensor; software-hardware systems for implementation of Lamb-wave-based damage identification including Lamb wave signal generation, acquisition and processing; and representative case studies and diverse engineering applications.},

abstract = {In the past two decades, acoustic-wave devices have gained enormous interest for sensor applications. The delay line device, where a transmitting and a receiving interdigital transducer are realized on a (piezoelectric) substrate is the most common structure used. The sensitive part is the surface between the two transducers. By placing the device in the feedback loop of an amplifier, an acoustic-wave oscillator is formed with properties such as inherent high sensitivity, high resolution, high stability and a frequency output signal which is easy to process. A very interesting development is the large amount of wave types now available for sensor applications. Sensors have been published using Rayleigh waves, Lamb waves, Love waves, acoustic plate modes, and surface transverse waves (STW). Each of these wave types have their special advantages and disadvantages with respect to sensitivity, stability, usability in liquids or gases, and fabrication complexity. For the fabrication of the acoustic-wave devices, planar technologies are used, which will be discussed in the paper. Examples will be given of gas sensors, biochemical sensors in liquids, viscosity and density sensing and high-voltage sensing. A comparison of the usability of the different wave types will be presented. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

A combined pressure/temperature sensor with identification has been developed based on LiNbO3 substrate for condition monitoring applications in the baking industry. Due to the given temperature specification and to avoid adhesives, the design of the sensor was conceived as a classical beam arrangement supported by three balls. This paper presents an overview on the design process of the sensor beginning with the mechanical simulation of the sensor and the derivation of the SAW delay line to measure pressure, temperature, and to realize an ID functionality. The main result is a pressure sensitivity of 3.7 rad/bar with a temperature drift of 0.013 rad° C. The sensitivity of the pressure sensor is also temperature dependent. This compound temperature drift can be compensated with the inherent temperature information of sensor. {\textcopyright} 2001-2012 IEEE.},

We characterized the luminescent properties of the thermographic phosphor particles YAG:Dy,Er seeded to the gas flow in a flow cell. The particles were excited by a laser sheet of a 355 nm Nd:YAG laser, and two intensified cameras were used for two-color detection of the phosphorescence spectrum. The calibration cell enables homogeneous and repeatable measurement conditions. A newly designed seeder allowed to adjust the number of particles in the cell, achieving sufficient seeding densities even at low flow rates in a wide temperature range. Additionally, the influence of the seeding density and the laser fluence on the intensity ratio were studied, both having negligible effects on the estimated temperature.},

@article{Muir2009,
abstract = {This thesis describes procedures and theory for a family of one-sided ultrasonic methods for determining third order elastic constants (TOEC) using sets of angle-beam wedges mounted on one side of a specimen. The methods are based on the well-known acoustoelastic effect, which is the change of wave speed with applied loads and is a consequence of the mechanical nonlinearity of a material. Increases in material nonlinearity have been correlated to the progression of damage, indicating that tracking changes in TOECs may provide a practical means of monitoring damage accumulation at the microstructural level prior to formation of macroscopic defects. Ultrasonic methods are one of the only ways to measure TOECs, and most prior techniques have utilized wave propagation paths parallel and perpendicular to the loading directions. A few additional ultrasonic techniques reported in the literature have employed oblique paths but with immersion coupling. These reported techniques are generally unsuitable for field implementation. The one-sided contact approach described here is applicable for in situ measurements of TOECs and thus lays the foundation for tracking of TOECs with damage. Theory is reviewed and further developed for calculating predicted velocity changes, and thus time shifts, as a function of uniaxial tensile loading for longitudinal, shear vertical, and shear horizontal waves in the context of angle-beam transducers mounted on the surface of the specimen. A comparison is made to published results where possible. The inverse problem of determining the three TOECs of an isotropic material from three measurements employing three different angle beam configurations is comprehensively analyzed. Four configurations providing well-posed solutions are identified and examined. A detailed sensitivity analysis is carried out to identify the best mounting configuration, wave mode combinations, refracted angles and geometry requirements for recovering the three TOECs. Two transducer mounting configurations are considered: (1) attached (glued-on) transducers potentially suitable for in situ monitoring, and (2) floating (oil-coupled) transducers potentially suitable for single measurements. Limited experimental results are presented for the attached case using two longitudinal measurements and one shear vertical measurement. The floating case experiments utilized three of the four well-posed solutions, and measurements were made on several aluminum alloys and low carbon steel. Key experimental issues are identified and discussed for both transducer mounting configurations.},

abstract = {In recent years, Higher Order Modes Cluster (HOMC) guided waves have been considered for ultrasonic testing of plates and pipes. HOMC guided waves consist of higher order Lamb wave modes that travel together as a single nondispersive wave packet. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of frequency-thickness value on the contribution of Lamb wave modes in an HOMC guided wave. This is an important issue that has not been thoroughly investigated before. The contribution of each Lamb wave mode in an HOMC guided wave is studied by using a two-dimensional finite element model. The level of contribution of various Lamb wave modes to the wave cluster is verified by using a 2D FFT analysis. The results show that by increasing the frequency-thickness value, the order of contributing modes in the HOMC wave packet increases. The number of modes that comprise a cluster also increases up to a specific frequency-thickness value and then it starts to decrease. Plotting of the cross-sectional displacement patterns along the HOMC guided wave paths confirms the shifting of dominant modes from lower to higher order modes with increase of frequency-thickness value. Experimental measurements conducted on a mild steel plate are used to verify the finite element simulations. The experimental results are found to be in good agreement with simulations and confirm the changes observed in the level of contribution of Lamb wave modes in a wave cluster by changing the frequency-thickness value.},

The heated flow passed through a perforated film hole plate and impacted on the internal surface of a vane wall. The particle-laden impingement jets resulted in the buildup of deposit cones associated with individual impingement jets. The deposit growth rate increased with flow temperature and when the film hole plate temperature was elevated with backside heating. At low temperatures, deposit formed not only as individual cones, but as ridges located at the midplanes between impinging jets. The base diameter of the deposit structures were found to be larger than the impingement hole diameter due in part to an aerodynamic lensing effect. Further studies using a test piece with optical access were used to document the evolution of deposit cones during continuous deposition.},

In this work, the elastic, dielectric, and piezoelectric constants of AlN single crystals were investigated at elevated temperatures up to 1000°C by the resonance method. We used resonators of five different modes to obtain a complete set of material constants of AlN single crystals. The electrical resistivity of AlN at elevated temperature (1000°C) was found to be greater than 5 × 1010 $\Omega${\textperiodcentered} cm. The resonance frequency of the resonators, which was mainly determined by the elastic compliances, decreased linearly with increasing temperature, and was characterized by a relatively low temperature coefficient of frequency, in the range of -20 to -36 ppm/°C. For all the investigated resonator modes, the elastic constants and the electromechanical coupling factors exhibited excellent temperature stability, with small variations over the full temperature range, {\textless}11.2{\%} and {\textless}17{\%}, respectively. Of particular significance is that due to the pyroelectricity of AlN, both the dielectric and the piezoelectric constants had high thermal resistivity even at extreme high temperature (1000°C). Therefore, high electrical resistivity, temperature independence of electromechanical properties, as well as high thermal resistivity of the elastic, dielectric, and piezoelectric properties, suggest that AlN single crystals are a promising candidate for high-temperature piezoelectric sensing applications.},

The self-sensing capability is introduced by embedding optically active rare earth ions into the thermal barrier ceramic. When illuminated by light the material starts to phosphoresce and the phosphorescence can provide in-situ information on temperature, phase changes, corrosion or erosion of the coating subject to the coating design. Quantitative measures of the degradation can be collected by non-destructive means such that the deterioration could be monitored. The results from different applications of the technology illustrate how the techniques could be used to gather information to move towards predictive maintenance routines. In addition, sensor TBCs can be employed to conduct temperature measurements either during operation or off-line to optimise operating conditions and reliably move to more efficient engine operation. Temperature measurements have been demonstrated during operation of a gas turbine. Furthermore, coatings have been installed in a UK power station and the profile of the luminescence decay time indicates the operating temperature map which corroborated with micrograph analysis.},

abstract = {Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)-based thermal barrier coating (TBC) has been integrated with thermographic phosphors through air plasma spray (APS) for in-depth; non-contact temperature sensing. This coating consisted of a thin layer of Dy-doped YSZ (about 40 $\mu$m) on the bottom and a regular YSZ layer with a thickness up to 300 $\mu$m on top. A measurement system has been established; which included a portable; low-cost diode laser (405 nm); a photo-multiplier tube (PMT) and the related optics. Coating samples with different topcoat thickness were calibrated in a high-temperature furnace from room temperature to around 900 °C. The results convincingly showed that the current sensor and the measurement system was capable of in-depth temperature sensing over 800 °C with a YSZ top layer up to 300 $\mu$m. The topcoat thickness was found to have a strong effect on the luminescent signal level. Therefore; the measurement accuracy at high temperatures was reduced for samples with thick topcoats due to strong light attenuation. However; it seemed that the light transmissivity of YSZ topcoat increased with temperature; which would improve the sensor's performance at high temperatures. The current sensor and the measurement technology have shown great potential in on-line monitoring of TBC interface temperature.},

abstract = {Online line-of-sight (LOS) pyrometer is used on certain jet engines for diagnosis and control functions such as hot-blade detection, high-temperature limiting, and conditionbased monitoring. Hot particulate bursts generated from jet engine combustor at certain running conditions lead to intermittent high-voltage signal outputs from the LOS pyrometer which is ultimately used by the onboard digital engine controller (DEC). To study the nature of hot particulates and enable LOS pyrometer functioning under burst conditions, a multicolor pyrometry (MCP) system was developed under DARPA funded program and tested on an aircraft jet engine. Soot particles generated as byproduct of combustion under certain conditions was identified as the root cause for the signal burst in a previous study. The apparent emissivity was then used to remove burst signals. In current study, the physics based filter with MCP algorithm using apparent emissivity was further extended to real-time engine control by removing burst signals at real time (1 MHz) and at engine DEC data rate. Simulink models are used to simulate the performances of the filter designs under engine normal and burst conditions. The results are compared with current LOS pyrometer results and show great advantage. The proposed model enables new LOS pyrometer design for improved engine control over wide range of operating conditions.},

However, owing to harsh operation conditions of SOFCs and limited available space in stack configuration, the number of techniques available to obtain temperature distribution from the cell surface is limited. The authors previously developed and studied a thermocouple array pattern to detect surface temperature distribution on an SOFC in open circuit conditions. In this study, the performance in terms of mechanical durability and oxidation state of the thin film thermoelements of the thermocouple array on the porous SOFC cathode is investigated. A thin-film multi-junction thermocouple array was sputter deposited using a magnetron sputter coater. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterisation techniques were carried out to understand characteristics of the thin film before and after temperature (20 °C–800 °C) measurement. Temperature readings from the sensor agreed well with the closely placed commercial thermocouple during heating segments. However, a sensor failure occurred at around 350 °C during the cooling segment. The SEM and XPS tests revealed cracks on the thin film thermoelements and oxidation to the film thickness direction.},

abstract = {Conventional ultrasonic transducers cannot withstand high temperatures for two main reasons: the piezoelectric elements within them depolarize, and differential thermal expansion of the different materials within a transducer causes them to fail. In this paper, the design of a high-temperature ultrasonic thickness gauge that bypasses these problems is described. The system uses a waveguide to isolate the vulnerable transducer and piezoelectric elements from the high-temperature measurement zone. Use of thin and long waveguides of rectangular cross section allows large temperature gradients to be sustained over short distances without the need for additional cooling equipment. The main problems that had to be addressed were the transmission and reception of ultrasonic waves into and from the testpiece that the waveguides are coupled to, and optimization of the wave propagation along the waveguide itself. It was found that anti-plane shear loading performs best at transmitting and receiving from the surface of a component that is to be inspected. Therefore, a nondispersive guided wave mode in large-aspect-ratio rectangular strips was employed to transmit the anti-plane shear loading from the transducer to the measurement zone. Different joining methods to attach the waveguides to the component were investigated and experiments showed that clamping the waveguides to the component surface gave the best results. The thickness of different plate samples was consistently measured to within less than 0.1 mm. Performance at high temperatures was tested in a furnace at 730°C for 4 weeks without signal degradation. Thicknesses in the range of 3 to 25 mm could be monitored using Hanning windowed tonebursts with 2 MHz center frequency.},

Thermal barrier coating prime reliance and further advances have been hampered by TBC loss by particle impact and erosion in certain locations of the turbine blades. Accumulation of low melting eutectic containing calcia, magnesia, alumina and silica resulting in TBC spallation limits maximum surface temperature. Design methodologies to address durability and data scatter issues are discussed. Compositions, morphology, characteristics and performance data for new bonds to achieve longer TBC life are described. Further reduction in the thermal conductivity of the top layer to minimise the parasitic mass of the coating on the component is being sought via top layer composition and processing modifications as well as by alternate ceramic compositions.

abstract = {The ability to measure temperature in extreme environments such as the hot sections of gas turbines is critically important. Several on-line techniques exist but it is often not possible to measure in real-time the temperature of all surfaces of interest. Indeed, some surfaces are so inaccessible as to require complex, costly and intrusive instrumentation for on-line temperature measurement. Here, off-line sensors, also called thermal history sensors, can be used to record the temperatures to which they are exposed, in such a way that they can be extracted later off-line, at room temperature. Probably the best-known types of thermal history sensor are the colour changing thermal paints, that are widely used in gas turbine development. These have been valuable tools of engine developers for many years, but their use presents a number of challenges so that alternatives would be welcome. This paper reports the latest developments of a thermal history sensor based on phosphors that undergo permanent changes in their luminescence properties when exposed to high temperatures. Such thermal history sensors have several advantages over and address many of the shortcomings of existing sensors. The paper contains details of the application of a phosphor-based temperature indicating paint based on Y2SiO5:Tb suspended in a chemical binder. The binder was found to influence the optical properties of the phosphor but despite this, a viable sensor paint for temperatures in the range 400°C to 900°C was formed. A thermal history coating was installed using a thermal barrier coating architecture, applied on various components of a Royce-Rolls Viper 201 engine owned by STS and operated for a number of hours at Cranfield University. Post-operation analysis revealed a temperature distribution on the surfaces/components and enabled hotspots to be identified. Overall the results suggest that phosphor-based temperature indicating paints have the potential to surpass the capability of existing paints. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012 by ASME.},

One advantage SH waves have over some wave types, is their ability to propagate around curved surfaces with little energy loss; to understand the geometries around which they could propagate, the wave reflection must be quantified. A 0.83 mm thick aluminium sheet was placed in a bending machine, and a shallow bend was introduced. Periodically-poled magnet (PPM) electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs), for emission and reception of SH waves, were placed on the same side of the bend, so that reflected waves were received. Additional bending of the sheet demonstrated a clear relationship between bend angles and the reflected signal. Models suggest that the reflection is a linear superposition of the reflections from each bend segment, such that sharp turns lead to a larger peak-to-peak amplitude, in part due to increased phase coherence. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper experimentally and numerically investigates heat transfer characteristics of a low-pressure turbine blade under steady/unsteady flow conditions. Generally, the low-pressure turbine blades are not exposed to excessive temperatures that require detailed heat transfer predictions. In aircraft engines, they operate at low Re-numbers causing the inception of large separation bubbles on their suction surface. As documented in previous papers, the results of detailed aerodynamic simulations have shown significant discrepancies with experiments. It was the objective of the current investigation to determine the discrepancies between the experimental and numerical heat transfer results. It is shown that small errors in aero-calculation results in large deviations of heat transfer results. The characteristics of the blades mentioned above, make low-pressure turbine blades suitable candidates for evaluating the predictive capability of any numerical method. Documenting the scope of these discrepancies defines the framework of the current paper. The periodic flow inside the gas turbine engine was simulated using the cascade facility at the Turbomachinery Performance and Flow Research Laboratory (TPFL) of Texas A{\&}M University. In this study, the wakes that originate from stator blades were simulated by moving rods. The instrumented blade was covered with a liquid crystal sheet and it was used to measure heat transfer coefficient. Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations were used for numerical investigation purposes. Measurements and simulations were conducted at three different Reynolds numbers (110,000, 150,000, and 250,000). Furthermore, for unsteady flow condition, reduced frequencies of the incoming wakes were varied. The current paper includes a comprehensive heat transfer assessment of the predictive capability of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes based tools. The effect of the separation bubbles on heat transfer is thoroughly discussed in this paper. Comparisons of the experimental and numerical results detail the differences and identify the sources of error that leads to in accurate calculations in terms of predicting heat transfer calculation results.},

abstract = {Extreme conditions are common in energy conversion, material processing, nuclear, airspace, and military applications. In such environments, the most hardened insertion sensors do not perform reliably for long. Ultrasonic measurements, on the other hand, can be acquired noninvasively, with sensitive components kept away from the damaging environment. We have previously developed the ultrasonic method for measuring the spatial distribution of temperatures in solid materials applicable in the cases when large thermal gradients are present. In the developed approach, we use the echogenically segmented ultrasound propagation path, structured to contain engineered or naturally occurring echogenic features, to produce a train of echoes in response to an external pulse of ultrasonic excitation. The delays between the echoes, which encode the information on the temperature distribution in the corresponding segments, is used to reconstruct unknown temperature profile. In this paper, we outline the results of pilot-scale testing of the developed approach and demonstrate its application to the measurements of the temperature distribution across the containment of a high-temperature combustion process. The validation results show that the estimated temperature profile is correctly captured, and the measurement accuracy can be comparable with traditional insertion sensors, such as thermocouples. Overall, the testing has confirmed that the developed approach has matured to become an attractive alternative to conventional sensing in solving challenging problems of long-term temperature measurements in extreme environments. Heat fluxes and thermal stresses in the structure can then be characterized noninvasively using the measured temperature distribution as the basis.},

The interaction between Lamb waves with a notch perpendicular to the upper surface of the plate for different Lamb wave modes is simulated to interrogate the effect of presence notch on Lamb wave propagation.

Firstly, SAW sensors of each cut with 50 different layouts were designed and fabricated according to the calculated SAW velocity, and a general wireless measurement platform was setup. Secondly, under the same test conditions, Q factor, temperature sensitivity and decaying waves of these sensors were tested, and along with the calculated temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF), these parameters were finally compared respectively. After comparison, the conclusions are as follows: LiNbO3 sensors had higher temperature sensitivity, and showed superiority without the limitation of distance in wireless measurements, while quartz sensors performed well when the distance increased, and this suggests they can be applied to long distance sensing for their high Q factor even the sensitivity is moderate. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {Guided ultrasonic waves are of significant interest in the health monitoring of thin structures, and dispersion curves are important tools in the deployment of any guided wave application. Most methods of determining dispersion curves require accurate knowledge of the material properties and thickness of the structure to be inspected, or extensive experimental tests. This paper presents an experimental technique that allows rapid generation of dispersion curves for guided wave applications when knowledge of the material properties and thickness of the structure to be inspected are unknown. The technique uses a single source and measurements at two points, making it experimentally simple. A formulation is presented that allows calculation of phase and group velocities if the wavepacket propagation time and relative phase shift can be measured. The methodology for determining the wavepacket propagation time and relative phase shift from the acquired signals is described. The technique is validated using synthesized signals, finite element model-generated signals and experimental signals from a 3 mm-thick aluminium plate. Accuracies to within 1{\%} are achieved in the experimental measurements.},

For aluminum the dilatometric expansion appears to be slightly greater than the x-ray expansion. If this discrepancy is real, it corresponds to a vacancy concentration at the melting point of aluminum of about 3×10-4.

abstract = {Thermally induced strains and stresses developed during direct-chill (DC) semicontinuous casting of high strength aluminum alloys can result in formation of micro-cracks in different locations of the billet. Rapid propagation of such micro-cracks in tensile thermal stress fields can lead to catastrophic failure of ingots in the solid state called cold cracking. Numerical models can simulate the thermomechanical behavior of an ingot during casting and after solidification and reveal the critical cooling conditions that result in catastrophic failure, provided that the constitutive parameters of the material represent genuine as-cast properties. Application of fracture mechanics, on the other hand, can help to derive the critical crack length leading to failure. In the present research work, the state of residual thermal stresses was determined in an AA7050 billet during DC casting by means of ALSIM5. Simulation results showed that in the steady-state conditions, large compressive stresses form near the surface of the billet in the circumferential direction, whereas in the center, the stresses are tensile in all directions. Magnitudes of von Mises effective stresses, the largest component of principal stresses and the fracture mechanics concepts, were then applied to investigate the crack susceptibility of the billet. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Minerals, Metals {\&} Materials Society and ASM International.},

This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

To determine the cause of damage, evaluations including visual inspections, microstructural investigations, and finite element method (FEM) analyses were carried out on the damaged nozzle. The microstructural investigations were performed through evaluation of the microstructure near the damaged area using optical and scanning electron microscopes. The FEM analyses performed to determine the temperature and stress distribution at different points of the nozzle. The results of visual inspections and microscopic investigations revealed the signs of microstructural degradations and hot corrosion near some of the cracks on the trailing edge of the NGVs. The results of the FEM analyses showed that due to the temperature gradient, thermal stresses are arisen in the nozzle components and caused thermal fatigue occurrence. Based on the analyses, it was concluded that the thermal fatigue is the dominant mechanism for premature damage of the second stage nozzle guide vanes of the gas turbine. Moreover, the simultaneous occurrence of microstructural degradations and hot corrosion on the NGVs, has a supplementary effect on the propagation of the cracks in addition to thermal fatigue.},

The sensors are robust, work passively without a battery, can be applied at high temperatures, and provide a high resolution. Nevertheless, if the devices are used wirelessly in an industrial environment, several constraints have to be taken into account, especially when more than one quantity or device needs to be measured at the same time. The paper addresses the challenges that must be tackled when establishing multi-sensor-wireless-readout for industrial applications. Major issues here are the legal regulations for industrial, scientific and medical frequency bands (ISM-bands), as well as sampling time and costs, which impose severe restrictions to any system design. We describe several design approaches and their constraints. We successfully designed sensors based on reflective delay lines that allow the parallel readout of four independent temperature sensors in the 2.45 GHz ISM-band. These devices were fabricated and positively tested, demonstrating the applicability of SAW sensors for industrial applications.},

abstract = {The present two-part work deals with a detailed characterization of the flow field and heat transfer distribution in a model of a rotating ribbed channel performed in a novel setup which allows test conditions at high rotation numbers (Ro). The tested model is mounted on a rotating frame with all the required instrumentation, resulting in a high spatial resolution and accuracy. The channel has a cross section with an aspect ratio of 0.9 and a ribbed wall with eight ribs perpendicular to the main flow direction. The blockage of the ribs is 10{\%} of the channel cross section, whereas the rib pitch-to-height ratio is 10. In this second part of the study, the heat transfer distribution over the wall region between the sixth and seventh ribs is obtained by means of liquid crystal thermography (LCT). Tests were first carried out at a Reynolds number of 15,000 and a maximum Ro of 1.00 to evaluate the evolution of the heat transfer with increasing rotation. On the trailing side (TS), the overall Nusselt number increases with rotation until a limit value of 50{\%} higher than in the static case, which is achieved after a value of the rotation number of about 0.3. On the leading side (LS), the overall Nusselt number decreases with increasing rotation speed to reach a minimum which is approximately 50{\%} of the one found in static conditions. The velocity measurements at Re=15,000 and Ro=0.77 provided in Part I of this paper are finally merged to provide a consistent explanation of the heat transfer distribution in this model. Moreover, heat transfer measurements were performed at Reynolds numbers of 30,000 and 55,000, showing approximately the same trend.},

An electromechanical (EM) piezoelectric-based system is one of the potential technologies that can produce a compactable system with a fast response and a high power density. However, piezoelectric materials generate a small strain, of around 0.1–0.2{\%} of the original actuator length, limiting their potential in large-scale applications. This paper reviews the potential amplification mechanisms for piezoelectric-based systems targeting aerospace applications. The concepts, structural designs, and operation conditions of each method are summarized and compared. This review aims to provide a good understanding of piezoelectric-based systems toward selecting suitable designs for potential aerospace applications and an outlook for novel designs in the near future.},

abstract = {Temperature profiling of components in gas turbines is of increasing importance as engineers drive to increase firing temperatures and optimize component's cooling requirements in order to increase efficiency and lower CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} emissions. However, on-line temperature measurements and, particularly, temperature profiling are difficult, sometimes impossible, to perform due to inaccessibility of the components. A desirable alternative would be to record the exposure temperature in such a way that it can be determined later, off-line. The commercially available thermal paints are toxic in nature and come with a range of technical disadvantages such as subjective readout and limited durability. This paper proposes a novel alternative measurement technique which the authors call thermal history paints and thermal history coatings. These can be particularly useful in the design process, but further could provide benefits in the maintenance area where hotspots which occurred during operation can be detected during maintenance intervals when the engine is at ambient temperature. This novel temperature profiling technique uses optical active ions in a ceramic host material. When these ions are excited by light they start to phosphoresce. The host material undergoes irreversible changes when exposed to elevated temperatures and since these changes are on the atomic level they influence the phosphorescent properties such as the life time decay of the phosphorescence. The changes in phosphorescence can be related to temperature through calibration such that in situ analysis will return the temperature experienced by the coating. A major benefit of this technique is in the automated interpretation of the coatings. An electronic instrument is used to measure the phosphorescence signal eliminating the need for a specialist interpreter, and thus increasing readout speed. This paper reviews results from temperature measurements made with a water-based paint for the temperature range 100-800°C in controlled conditions. Repeatability of the tests and errors are discussed. Further, some measurements are carried out using an electronic hand-held interrogation device which can scan a component surface and provide a spatial resolution of below 3 mm. The instrument enables mobile measurements outside of laboratory conditions. Further, a robust thermal history coating is introduced demonstrating the capability of the coating to withstand long term exposures. The coating is based on thermal barrier coating (TBC) architecture with a high temperature bondcoat and deposited using an air plasma spray process to manufacture a reliable long lasting coating. Such a coating could be employed over the life of the component to provide critical temperature information at regular maintenance intervals for example indicating hot spots on engine parts.},

abstract = {The optical pyrometer is a widely used instrument for measuring the temperature of gas turbine blade targets. However, one of the limitations of this instrument is the measurement error caused by reflected radiation from the high-temperature surrounding environment. This paper presents an analysis of such measurement error with consideration of a wavelength detection range of 2.5 to 22 $\mu$m with blade thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) ranging from 18 to 279 $\mu$m. Surface temperature distributions were simulated using the software ANSYS CFX. Radiation heat transfer was calculated based on discretized triangular surface elements. The variation characteristics of relative temperature error under different wavelengths and TBC thicknesses were obtained. The results obtained are well suited to provide theoretical guidance for choosing the wavelength of a pyrometer when measuring blade temperature with different TBC thickness, and can also be used to provide a method for estimating and correcting the temperature error.},

abstract = {There is a need to better understand the effect of temperature changes on the response of ultrasonic guided-wave pitch-catch systems used for structural health monitoring. A model is proposed to account for all relevant temperature-dependent parameters of a pitch-catch system on an isotropic plate, including the actuator-plate and plate-sensor interactions through shear-lag behavior, the piezoelectric and dielectric permittivity properties of the transducers, and the Lamb wave dispersion properties of the substrate plate. The model is used to predict the S0 and A0 response spectra in aluminum plates for the temperature range of -40-+60°C, which accounts for normal aircraft operations. The transducers examined are monolithic PZT-5A [PZT denotes Pb (Zr-Ti) O3] patches and flexible macrofiber composite type P1 patches. The study shows substantial changes in Lamb wave amplitude response caused solely by temperature excursions. It is also shown that, for the transducers considered, the response amplitude changes follow two opposite trends below and above ambient temperature (20°C), respectively. These results can provide a basis for the compensation of temperature effects in guided-wave damage detection systems. {\textcopyright} 2008 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract = {Ultrasonic-based distance measurements using time-of-flight (TOF) is a fundamental technique for different applications across a wide variety of fields. In general, cross correlation between a transmitted and received signal is considered to be the optimal TOF estimation technique, which produces a peak at the time delay between them. Cross correlation provides a superior performance in conjunction with a linear chirp. However, as its accuracy depends on the width of the peak, which is inversely proportional to the signal's bandwidth, it can only be said to be highly accurate if the reflected signal at the receiver is separated in time by more than the width of the correlation peak; otherwise, errors are introduced into the system. To improve its accuracy, the bandwidth of the transmitted signal must be increased, which increases the system cost. In this paper, to solve this problem, a $\backslash$text {\{}threshold-based{\}}$\backslash$,$\backslash$,$\backslash$text {\{}phase-correlation{\}} technique is proposed, which is able to provide a much narrower peak than cross correlation without increasing the signal's physical bandwidth. To evaluate the proposed method, in a controlled environment, two experiments were performed under low and high multipath conditions. For an operational range of 600 mm (indoor), the root-mean-square errors were [0.10, 0.56] mm and [0.19, 1.19] mm for low and high multipath environments, respectively, which indicate that the proposed technique is precise enough to support high accuracy applications.},

abstract = {The process of implementing a damage identification strategy for aerospace, civil and mechanical engineering infrastructure is referred to as structural health monitoring (SHM). Here, damage is defined as changes to the material and/or geometric properties of these systems, including changes to the boundary conditions and system connectivity, which adversely affect the system's performance. A wide variety of highly effective local non-destructive evaluation tools are available for such monitoring. However, the majority of SHM research conducted over the last 30 years has attempted to identify damage in structures on a more global basis. The past 10 years have seen a rapid increase in the amount of research related to SHM as quantified by the significant escalation in papers published on this subject. The increased interest in SHM and its associated potential for significant life-safety and economic benefits has motivated the need for this theme issue. This introduction begins with a brief history of SHM technology development. Recent research has begun to recognize that the SHM problem is fundamentally one of the statistical pattern recognition (SPR) and a paradigm to address such a problem is described in detail herein as it forms the basis for organization of this theme issue. In the process of providing the historical overview and summarizing the SPR paradigm, the subsequent articles in this theme issue are cited in an effort to show how they fit into this overview of SHM. In conclusion, technical challenges that must be addressed if SHM is to gain wider application are discussed in a general manner. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Lamb waves can propagate many metres along plate and shell structures, and so have great potential in 'smart structure' applications where it is important for a transducer to interrogate a significant area of the surrounding structure. However, there are many different types of Lamb wave and in order to obtain simple signals that can be reliably interpreted, it is important to excite a single mode in a well controlled direction. The choice of which Lamb wave mode to use in a particular application depends on numerous factors, including the resolution required, the type of defects or damage to be detected, the attenuation and the available transduction options. This paper sets out a rational procedure for identifying suitable Lamb wave modes and operating frequencies for a particular inspection task. It is shown that the properties of the system to be inspected determine which mode and frequencies can be used, and that this then dictates the type of transducer required. A procedure for evaluating the performance of Lamb wave transducers is also demonstrated. As an illustrative example, it is shown that the well known angle incidence transduction technique is not generally suitable in applications where the structure to be inspected is liquid loaded. In such cases it is necessary to consider alternative transduction options such as electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) or shear piezoelectric devices. {\textcopyright} 2002 Sage Publications.},

Tomographic reconstruction with Lamb waves allows for the accurate reconstruction of the variation of quantities of interest throughout the investigated region, and it presents the data as a quantitative map. The location, shape, and extent of flaws can then be easily extracted from this tomographic image. The scattering of Lamb waves from severe flaws introduces artifacts in such reconstructions, however. In this paper higher order plate theory is used to derive analytical solutions for the scattering of the lowest order symmetric Lamb waves from a circular inclusion, focusing in particular on isolated through holes in plates. Plane wave and point source scattering behavior is explored for holes of different diameters, and a finite-beam solution is constructed by superposition of point source solutions. These results are then used to explain the scattering effects seen in Lamb wave contact scanning tomographic reconstructions. {\textcopyright} 1999 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Lamb waves can propagate many metres along plate and shell structures, and so have great potential in 'smart structure' applications where it is important for a transducer to interrogate a significant area of the surrounding structure. However, there are many different types of Lamb wave and in order to obtain simple signals that can be reliably interpreted, it is important to excite a single mode in a well controlled direction. The choice of which Lamb wave mode to use in a particular application depends on numerous factors, including the resolution required, the type of defects or damage to be detected, the attenuation and the available transduction options. This paper sets out a rational procedure for identifying suitable Lamb wave modes and operating frequencies for a particular inspection task. It is shown that the properties of the system to be inspected determine which mode and frequencies can be used, and that this then dictates the type of transducer required. A procedure for evaluating the performance of Lamb wave transducers is also demonstrated. As an illustrative example, it is shown that the well known angle incidence transduction technique is not generally suitable in applications where the structure to be inspected is liquid loaded. In such cases it is necessary to consider alternative transduction options such as electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) or shear piezoelectric devices. {\textcopyright} 2002 Sage Publications.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) using guided waves is one of the only ways in which damage anywhere in a structure can be detected using a sparse array of permanently attached sensors. To distinguish damage from structural features, some form of comparison with damage-free reference data is essential, and here subtraction is considered. The detectability of damage is determined by the amplitude of residual signals from structural features remaining after the subtraction of reference data. These are non-zero due to changing environmental conditions such as temperature. In this paper, the amplitude of the residual signals is quantified for different guided-wave SHM strategies. Comparisons are made between two methods of reference signal subtraction and between two candidate sensor configurations. These studies allow estimates to be made of the number of sensors required per unit area to reliably detect a prescribed type of damage. It is shown that the number required is prohibitively high, even in the presence of modest temperature fluctuations, hence some form of temperature compensation is absolutely essential for guided-wave SHM systems to be viable. A potential solution is examined and shown to provide an improvement in signal suppression of approximately 30dB, which corresponds to two orders of magnitude reduction in the number of sensors required. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {The interaction of individual Lamb waves with a variety of defects simulated by notches has been investigated using finite-element analysis, the results being checked experimentally. Excellent agreement has been obtained between the numerical and experimental results and it has been shown that a two-dimensional (2-D) Fourier transform method that the authors have developed may be used to quantify Lamb wave interactions with defects in both experimental and numerical investigations. The results have shown that the sensitivity of individual Lamb waves to particular notches is dependent on the frequency-thickness product, the mode type (symmetric or antisymmetric), the mode order, and the geometry of the notch. The sensitivity of the Lamb modes a1, ao, and s0 to simulated defects in different frequency-thickness regions has been predicted as a function of the defect depth to plate thickness ratio (h/2d) and the results have indicated that Lamb waves may be used to find notches when the wavelength to notch depth ratio is of the order of 40. It has also been shown that provided the notch width is small compared to the wavelength, the transmission and reflection amplitudes are insensitive to changes in width, so the ratio of the depth of the notch to the plate thickness is the controlling parameter. Both the numerical and experimental results have shown that the transmission ratios of Lamb waves across defects are highly frequency dependent, particularly at higher frequency-thicknesses. The positions of the maxima and minima in the transmission curves are a function of notch depth that suggests that monitoring the change in transmission ratio with frequency may provide a means of defect sizing. {\textcopyright} 1992 IEEE},

abstract = {Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are applied to blades, vanes, combustion chamber walls, and exhaust nozzles in gas turbines not only to limit the heat transfer through the coatings but also to protect the metallic parts from the harsh oxidizing and corrosive thermal environment. There is a growing interest in operating these hot gas path (HGP) components at optimal conditions which has resulted in a continuous increase of the turbine inlet temperatures (TITs). This has resulted in the increase of heat load on the turbine components especially in the high pressure side of the turbine necessitating the need to protect the HGP components from the heat of the exhaust gases using novel TBC such as electron beam physical vapor deposition thermal barrier coatings (EBPVD TBCs) and Air Plasma Sprayed thermal barrier coatings (APS TBCs). This study focuses on the estimation of temperature distribution in the turbine metal substrate (IN738) and coating materials (EBPVD TBC and APS TBC) subjected to isothermal conditions (1573 K) around the turbine blade. The heat conduction in the turbine blade and TBC systems necessary for the evaluation of substrate thermal loads are assessed. The steady state 2D heat diffusion in the turbine blade is modeled using ANSYS FLUENT computational fluid dynamics (CFD) commercial package. Heat transfer by radiation is fully accounted for by solving the radiative transport equation (RTE) using the discrete ordinate method. The results show that APS TBCs are better heat flux suppressors than EBPVD TBCs due to differences in the morphology of the porosity present within the TBC layer. Increased temperature drops across the TBC leads to temperature reductions at the TGO/bond coat interface which slows the rate of the thermally induced failure mechanisms such as CTE mismatch strain in the TGO layer, growth rate of TGO, and impurity diffusion within the bond coat. {\textcopyright} 2010 by ASME.},

@article{Belkin1998c,
abstract = {This dissertation explores the link between civil-military relations and international conflict. In particular, I ask whether strategies that leaders invoke to protect themselves from their own militaries might under some conditions increase the risk of war. Even though civil-military relations is fundamental to state-building, and despite the sizable literature on domestic causes of international conflict, there is very little work on the international implications of regimes' efforts to protect themselves from their own militaries. My argument is that when coups are possible, usually leaders divide their armed forces into rival organizations that they intend to check and balance each other and protect the regime as a by-product of mutual suspicion. (I label this strategy counterbalancing). Counterbalancing depends on leaders' ability to keep their own armed forces apart by promoting conflict among them. But military elites may rebel if they come to understand how leaders profit from inter-organizational hostility. Hence, counterbalancing requires leaders to conceal control benefits they accrue when they induce their own forces to compete. Because international conflict conceals these benefits, leaders may invent enemies, prepare for war, and engage in low-level international disputes when their foundational objective is to use counterbalancing to subordinate their own militaries. Contrary to the sizable literature on scapegoating, my argument is that in the realm of civil-military relations regimes may use provocative foreign policy to reinforce institutional divisions rather than to achieve cohesion. The argument is tested via a multi-method strategy that includes a pooled, time-series analysis of almost every country in the world over the last two decades of the Cold War as well as historical case studies of civil-military relations in Syria in the early 1970's and Georgia in the mid-1990's.},

abstract = {Over the past two decades the work on thermographic phosphors was mainly carried out in the US. It is only in recent years that other research groups have explored the field. However, in the future turbine inlet temperatures are likely to increase in order to achieve higher efficiencies introducing greater stress on the components and in particular the turbine blade coatings. Thus there is a general need for advanced temperature detection methods such as thermographic phosphors. When illuminated with UV light they exhibit luminescence, which is temperature dependent by virtue of variations in the relative intensities of distinct emission lines or in the time constant of the exponential decay, which occurs once excitation has ceased. Thermographic phosphors could be employed for temperature detection in the hot section of a gas turbine and this technique promises temperature detection of up to 1400 o C with uncertainties better than for other remote standard techniques such as pyrometry. The paper will address the instrumentation development over recent months and sources of uncertainty when the technique is applied in the field. The paper briefly reviews the application of thermographic phosphors for surface temperature measurements in laboratory combustor of realistic geometry and also includes calculations for the cooling effectiveness. Uncertainties in the temperature can be caused by the data fitting algorithms, fluctuations of the laser power, changes in oxygen pressure and different gain settings of the detector. When observing the target area through a flame additional radiation can cause a higher noise level than for calibration measurements hence leading to higher uncertainties in temperature. The uncertainties vary with temperature, but usually decrease at higher temperature due to the nature of the calibration data. Highest uncertainties in temperature measurements in the combustor were less than 3.7{\%} for 'cool' areas and less than 1{\%} for 'hot' areas. A simulation of the data detection and processing systems shows the dependencies of the uncertainties on particular input parameters such as noise, observation time, time resolution and digitalization of the signal. Phosphorescent processes can be pressure sensitive as was demonstrated for so called 'Pressure Sensitive Paints' (PSP) by a variety of research groups. PSPs are widely used for measuring pressure distributions on surfaces. They are sensitive to the partial pressure of oxygen adjacent to the PSP. Thus studies were carried out for two standard thermographic phosphors (Y 2 O 3 : Eu, YAG: Dy) to simulate pressure changes at different temperatures by changing the oxygen level to investigate the oxygen/pressure sensitivity of these materials. Initial data shows that there is a rather small effect of changing oxygen pressure on the luminescence lifetime decay of the phosphors. For a simulated pressure drop of 0.24bar maximum uncertainties in temperature due to oxygen pressure were estimated to be within 2{\%}.},

Real-time data collection from sensors, combined with data analyt-ics, can improve safety and performance, and reduce operational and maintenance cost in harsh environments. Even though some sensors are available for harsh environments, it is still impossible to measure the real-time data wirelessly due to the lack of high temperature electronics and energy storage for the selected sensors. Typically, data is transferred with cables to cooler regions, where an external electronic box is set up. Due to complex wiring connections, reliability is poor, the sensor locations are restricted and the cost and weight of the sensing system is increased.

Accumulation of low melting eutectic containing calcia, magnesia, alumina and silica resulting in TBC spallation limits maximum surface temperature. Design methodologies to address durability and data scatter issues are discussed. Compositions, morphology, characteristics and performance data for new bonds to achieve longer TBC life are described.

abstract = {Damage detection in a mechanical structure using ultrasonic guided waves becomes even more problematic when the effect of variation in environmental and operating conditions, such as mechanical noise, temperature, flow rate, inner pressure, etc. is taken into account. The variation in these environmental and operating conditions can degrade the accuracy of the damage inspection process. The basic purpose of current research work is to propose a finite element model–based simulation model to identify and estimate the influence of environmental temperature on the measured signal and meanwhile perceive the temperature invariant points to provide an optimal baseline for thermal attenuation in real-time ultrasonic guided wave inspections. This model signifies the variation in material elastic properties, thermal sensitivities, and the abrupt changes in group and phase velocities of S0 wave mode with temperature. A low bandpass filter is used to keep the excitation frequency in a certain range and remove the noise from it. The numerical investigation is achieved in AbaqusTM on the basis of six parameters, including variation in strain rate and stress, the amplitude of displacement, symmetric and anti-symmetric dispersion curves, time of flight, group velocity, and natural frequency of the beam. A wave velocity function has been generated in the Matlab{\textregistered} environment to calculate the group velocity of guided waves considering the effect of both temperature and excitation frequency. A linear fit curve (first-degree polynomial) is utilized in this function to analyze the effect of temperature on group velocity. An analytical estimation has also been applied to evaluate the impact of temperature on the material properties and damage detection. The simulation model is validated against the analytical group velocity results and experimental wave amplitude results. The comparison with minute percentage error is achieved in a convincing manner. The proposed thermal sensitivity simulation model is more efficient and reliable as compared to optimal baseline selection and baseline signal stretch. It detects not only the occurrence of damage but also examines the influence of environmental temperature on ultrasonic guided wave propagation and perceives the temperature invariant points to provide an optimal baseline for thermal attenuation in real-time ultrasonic guided wave inspections. This model can also be implemented practically in transportation and industrial applications to ensure structural reliability.},

A discussion of the properties and applications of piezoelectric crystals and additional piezoelectric ceramics is followed by a description of several sensor configurations prepared from bulk ceramics. An extensive review and comparison of piezoelectric ceramic - polymer composite sensors based on the connectivity of the constituent phases is also presented.

abstract = {Ultrasonic Lamb modes typically propagate as a combination of multiple dispersive wave packets. Frequency components of each mode distribute widely in time domain due to dispersion and it is very challenging to separate individual modes by traditional signal processing methods. In the present study, a method of dispersion compensation is proposed for the purpose of mode separation. This numerical method compensates, i.e., compresses, the individual dispersive waveforms into temporal pulses, which thereby become nearly un-overlapped in time and frequency and can thus be extracted individually by rectangular time windows. It was further illustrated that the dispersion compensation also provided a method for predicting the plate thickness. Finally, based on reversibility of the numerical compensation method, an artificial dispersion technique was used to restore the original waveform of each mode from the separated compensated pulse. Performances of the compensation separation techniques were evaluated by processing synthetic and experimental signals which consisted of multiple Lamb modes with high dispersion. Individual modes were extracted with good accordance with the original waveforms and theoretical predictions.},

abstract = {In this work, an analysis of the transmission of ultrasonic signals generated by piezoelectric sensors for air applications is presented. Based on this analysis, an ultrasonic response model is obtained for its application to the recognition of objects and structured environments for navigation by autonomous mobile robots. This model enables the analysis of the ultrasonic response that is generated using a pair of sensors in transmitter-receiver configuration using the pulse-echo technique. This is very interesting for recognizing surfaces that simultaneously generate a multiple echo response. This model takes into account the effect of the radiation pattern, the resonant frequency of the sensor, the number of cycles of the excitation pulse, the dynamics of the sensor and the attenuation with distance in the medium. This model has been developed, programmed and verified through a battery of experimental tests. Using this model a new procedure for obtaining accurate time of flight is proposed. This new method is compared with traditional ones, such as threshold or correlation, to highlight its advantages and drawbacks. Finally the advantages of this method are demonstrated for calculating multiple times of flight when the echo is formed by several overlapping echoes. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {Military and commercial aerospace organizations are exploring structural health monitoring (SHM) systems to reduce maintenance costs and to verify the integrity of structural components exposed to harsh conditions. This technical note considers the use of Lamb waves to monitor plate and shell components of aerospace structures. For fielded applications, SHM systems will need to operate across a variety of environmental conditions, including large temperature ranges. Therefore, it is critical to understand the effects of temperature on Lamb wave propagation. The focus of this study is the effect of temperature on Lamb wave propagation in a constant-thickness metallic plate under isothermal conditions. Experimental measurements and analytical predictions are made over temperatures ranging from -18°C to 107°C. Results indicate that only small and predictable changes in the wave propagation behavior occur over the temperature range investigated. This is significant because it may allow SHM systems to be designed for aircraft systems operating within this range without the need for complex compensation techniques. {\textcopyright} 2008 Sage Publications.},

A combined pressure/temperature sensor with identification has been developed based on LiNbO3 substrate for condition monitoring applications in the baking industry. Due to the given temperature specification and to avoid adhesives, the design of the sensor was conceived as a classical beam arrangement supported by three balls. This paper presents an overview on the design process of the sensor beginning with the mechanical simulation of the sensor and the derivation of the SAW delay line to measure pressure, temperature, and to realize an ID functionality. The main result is a pressure sensitivity of 3.7 rad/bar with a temperature drift of 0.013 rad° C. The sensitivity of the pressure sensor is also temperature dependent. This compound temperature drift can be compensated with the inherent temperature information of sensor. {\textcopyright} 2001-2012 IEEE.},

Although each has the capability of measuring temperatures pertinent to monitoring TBCs, the finite thickness of typical coatings together with the optical properties of zirconia place severe restrictions on the depth from which the temperature sensing can be obtained. Some of these limitations can be circumvented using photo-stimulated luminescence with coatings containing dopants at specific locations. To illustrate this, it is demonstrated that by depositing coatings with a lanthanide dopant, such as Eu3+, at specific locations, for instance in contact with the metallic alloy, temperature sensing can be performed with much higher spatial resolution. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Ceramic Society.},

abstract = {Microwave acoustic devices have long been shown to provide sensitive platforms for physical and gas sensors. Piezoelectric substrates introduced over the past two decades, such as the langasite (LGS) family of crystals, gallium orthophosphate, and aluminum nitride have enabled the exploration of microwave acoustics sensing at temperatures above 500°C. However the ability of the substrate to withstand high temperatures is only one of the requirements for sensor operation in harsh environments. Other prerequisites are: the development of stable high-temperature device electrodes; appropriate packaging; and resilience of the entire system to thermal shock and thermal cycling. In this paper, the wireless operation of microwave acoustic wave sensors in harsh environments is reviewed, and recent achievements are highlighted. Particular focus is given to surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor technology because it has the advantage of being wireless, battery-free, and allows interrogation of arrays of multiple devices. During the last decade, wireless hostile environment microwave acoustic sensors that can detect gases and monitor temperature and pressure have transitioned from laboratory proof-of-concept to commercial devices and systems. Recent accomplishments in thin film technology and packaging are extending the technology to even higher temperatures, beyond 1000°C. These technological advances are enabling wireless microwave acoustic sensor applications in hostile environments including power plants, turbine engines, oil/gas refineries, and high temperature industrial processing. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Temperature is a critical parameter in many engineering applications, particularly in gas turbines, to avoid overheating of critical components and improve the efficiency of operation. Effective thermal management requires accurate temperature profiles in key locations; however, performing these measurements during operation is practically challenging, sometimes impossible due to inaccessibility of the components. A desirable alternative would be to record the exposure temperature in such a way that it can be determined later, off-line. Of the currently available off-line methods, Thermal Paints are arguably the most popular, however, are highly toxic in nature and come with a range of technical disadvantages such as subjective readout and limited durability. A novel, alternative measurement technique has been proposed by the authors and is under development. This technique uses phosphorescent sensor materials which undergo permanent changes with thermal exposure. The changes manifest in the phosphorescent properties of the material, such as the decay time. The technique has a plurality of technical and practical advantages over existing measurement methods. A major benefit is the automated electronic readout of the coating which eliminates the need to have a colour-trained operator and thus increases the speed of interpretation. This paper focuses on the progress made in the development of Thermal History Paints. The repeatability and error of measurements made using a purpose built electronic hand-held mobile device are discussed to demonstrate the practical application of the technology. Further a robust Thermal History Coating, based on Thermal Barrier Coating architecture, is introduced demonstrating the capability of the coating to withstand long term exposures and harsh environments. A comparison between a commercial thermal paint and the new thermal history technique is presented indicating the significant advantages of the proposed system.},

In this work, the elastic, dielectric, and piezoelectric constants of AlN single crystals were investigated at elevated temperatures up to 1000°C by the resonance method. We used resonators of five different modes to obtain a complete set of material constants of AlN single crystals. The electrical resistivity of AlN at elevated temperature (1000°C) was found to be greater than 5 × 1010 $\Omega${\textperiodcentered} cm. The resonance frequency of the resonators, which was mainly determined by the elastic compliances, decreased linearly with increasing temperature, and was characterized by a relatively low temperature coefficient of frequency, in the range of -20 to -36 ppm/°C. For all the investigated resonator modes, the elastic constants and the electromechanical coupling factors exhibited excellent temperature stability, with small variations over the full temperature range, {\textless}11.2{\%} and {\textless}17{\%}, respectively. Of particular significance is that due to the pyroelectricity of AlN, both the dielectric and the piezoelectric constants had high thermal resistivity even at extreme high temperature (1000°C). Therefore, high electrical resistivity, temperature independence of electromechanical properties, as well as high thermal resistivity of the elastic, dielectric, and piezoelectric properties, suggest that AlN single crystals are a promising candidate for high-temperature piezoelectric sensing applications.},

abstract = {The ever-increasing requirements on gas turbine efficiency and the simultaneous demand for reduced emissions, necessitate much more accurate calculations of the combustion process and combustor wall temperatures. Thermal history paints (THPs) is an innovative alternative to the established measurement techniques, but so far only a limited number of tests have been conducted under real engine conditions. A typical THP comprises oxide ceramic pigments and a water-based binder. The ceramic is synthesized to be amorphous and when heated it crystallizes, permanently changing the microstructure. The ceramic is doped with lanthanide ions to make it phosphorescent and as the structure of the material changes, so do the phosphorescent properties of the material. By measuring the phosphorescence, the maximum temperature of exposure can be determined, enabling postoperation measurements at ambient conditions. This paper describes a test in which THP was applied to an impingement-cooled front panel from a combustor of an industrial gas turbine. The panel was instrumented with a thermocouple (TC), and thermal paint was applied to the cold side of the impingement plate. The THP was applied to the hot-gas side of this plate for validation against the other measurement techniques and to evaluate its resilience against the reacting hot gas environment. The durability and temperature results of the three different measurement techniques are discussed. It is shown that the THP exhibited greater durability compared to the conventional thermal paint. Furthermore, the new technology provided detailed measurements indicating local temperature variations and global variations over the complete component.},

The transducer is split into segments so that the angular location of a reflector can be defined, the radial location of the reflector being determined from the time of arrival of the echo.},

abstract = {Lamb waves are currently used in many nondestructive testing applications to determine or monitor elastic properties of plate-like structures using various excitation methods. The methods vary from point-like dry contact transducers and laser ultrasound techniques in hostile environments to wedge transducers for inspection of immersed structures. In this paper, we analyze the excitation of Lamb waves in 2-D geometry by surface sources, as in the case of many applications. To calculate the coupling characteristics to various Lamb waves, we use the mode orthogonality principle and utilize the angular spectrum approach to find the field distributions on the surface excited by non contact transducers with finite dimensions. We present theoretical results related to Hertzian contact transducers at low frequencies along with some measurements in agreement with theory. We also investigate the wedge transducers exciting different Lamb wave modes in immersion mode.},

abstract = {This paper presents a fully reconfigurable and reliable PXIe-567X software-defined interrogation signal generator for surface acoustic wave (SAW)-based passive radio frequency identification (RFID). Contrary to most commercial SAW RFID readers that operate only at a unique predefined frequency, the proposed vector signal generator is aimed to operate at any frequency defined by the user, from 85 MHz to 6.6 GHz, including the 902-928 MHz and 2.45-GHz industrial scientific and medical bands. The PXIe-567X-based signal generator can accurately generate not only conventional ON-OFF keying (OOK)-modulated or pulsed binary phase shift keying (BPSK)-modulated SAW RFID interrogation signals, but also completely user-defined interrogation signals. A custom LabVIEW user interface that allows to control the carrier frequency, the power, and the waveform of the interrogation signal has been designed. The operator can switch between custom waveforms without resetting and reprogramming the whole system. The proposed RFID request signal generator has been validated using a complete measurement setup. Time-domain and frequency-domain validation tests of OOK modulated and wideband pulsed BPSK-modulated signal generation have been conducted at 170, 340, 915 MHz and 2.45 GHz. Very accurate results have been obtained. The PXIe-567X-based RFID interrogator has been tested with a fabricated 3-b SAW RFID tag. The operability of the entire SAW RFID system has been demonstrated.},

A detailed analysis of all elements which had an influence on the failure initiation was carried out, namely: decreasing of alloy ductility and toughness due to carbides precipitation in grain boundaries; grain growing (coarsening) and vane airfoil stress level. It was found that the vane crack initiation and propagation was drived by thermal fatigue mechanism. The vane crack initiation and propagation were due to fatigue mechanism which was facilitated by grain boundaries brittleness caused by formation of continuous film of carbides on grain boundaries, grains coarsening, and high thermal stress level. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {There is an increasing demand for turbine engines with improved performance and efficiency. Gas turbine efficiencies can be increased if higher turbine inlet temperatures are achieved. However, the optimum temperature is prescribed by the balance between the benefits of thermal efficiency and material life. Accurate thermal maps can allow engines to operate closer to their design limit, and greatly facilitate the design of improved engines. This article provides a review highlighting the advantages and rationale of using phosphor thermometry over existing temperature measurement techniques, such as thermocouple and pyrometry. Although phosphor thermometry exhibits excellent characteristics to make accurate measurements, the high temperature and fast rotating engine environment presents some challenges with interrelated issues that would need to be collectively considered before a successful measurement system can be implemented. Examples include extreme blackbody radiation, restricted optical access and time to collect data, etc. These factors will impose temperature limits and greatly influence the design philosophy of the measurement system, including phosphor choice, bonding technique, excitation/detection methodologies, and probe design. This article aims to provide an overview of these consideration factors, with supplementary design notes and guidance to aid engineers design and develop successful phosphor thermometry measurement systems for such environments. {\textcopyright} 2010 Authors.},

The detection of the Lamb wave are performed with either a laser interferom- eter or a second wedge–transducer combination and the results are benchmarked. A short–time Fourier transformation (STFT) is applied to the detected signal to extract the amplitudes of the first and second harmonics. A relative ratio of the first and second harmonics is deduced from nonlinear wave theory to assign the nonlinearity of the material. To verify the capability of the measurement setup and to show that cumulative second harmonics are generated, measurements for different propagation distances are performed. Further measurements on plasticly deformed specimens are carried out to examine the change of the material nonlinearity as a function of plas- ticity.},

The paper studies the effect of temperature on Lamb wave responses. The work involves a simple experiment in which two piezoelectric ceramics are bonded on an aluminium plate. The plate is exposed to various levels of temperature. A couple of simple features extracted from the Lamb wave responses are analysed to show the effect of the temperature changes.

abstract = {Turbine blade temperature measurements are important for monitoring the working state of the blades. However, the reflected radiation from the high temperature surrounding environment leads to significant error in the optical pyrometer measurements. This study calculates and compares temperature error of single wavelength pyrometer, ratio pyrometer and multicolor pyrometer in measuring turbine rotor blade temperature. Emissivity of the blade was measured in the wavelength range of 1.2 $\mu$m to 2.5 $\mu$m. Temperature distribution of the rotor blade and the guide vane was simulated by CFD software. Additionally, temperature error was calculated based on - discretization of a three-dimensional blade model. The results show that from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the rotor blade pressure side, the variation trend of the three kinds of pyrometer temperature error is the same, first decreasing, then increasing before decreasing again. The maximum relative temperature error was found to be 7.5{\%}, 4.9{\%} and 2.6{\%} when the wavelength of the pyrometer was 1.3 $\mu$m, 1.6 $\mu$m, 2.2 $\mu$m, respectively. The study also shows that wavelength selection has great influence on the ratio pyrometer. It was found that the maximum relative temperature error ranged from 2.6{\%} to 15.7{\%} based on the choice of the various wavelengths. On the other hand, the maximum relative temperature error of the multicolor pyrometer was 3.8{\%}. The analysis presented in this work will be of importance in providing guidelines for choosing the optimum measurement wavelengths for optical pyrometers. Furthermore, the finding will also useful in the calculation and correction of the optical pyrometer error.},

abstract = {Thin film thermocouples have the advantage of extremely fast response (≤1 ms), low cost, and very fine spatial resolution. These capabilities have permitted measurements never before possible, such as the instantaneous temperature measurements of the inside surfaces of a diesel engine cylinder during operation. Although these type S platinum plus platinum 10{\%} rhodium thermocouples are stable at the 900–1100 °C range, oxidation of rhodium can take place in the 600–800 °C range in air which lessens the thermoelectric potential of the positive element. We evaluated the effect of air exposures to high temperature thin film thermocouples and attempted to find solutions to the problem. We found that after 50 h at 750 °C the Seebeck coefficient of a platinum 10{\%} rhodium element was reduced 50{\%} compared to the as‐sputtered condition. The reduction of Seebeck coefficient at 700 and 800 °C was also substantial. This reduction in Seebeck coefficient could be recovered by annealing the thin film at 900 °C. The degradation after 750 °C could be suppressed using a 1 $\mu$m sputtered aluminum oxide coating. The reversible behavior suggests the formation of Rh2O3 at 700–800 °C and its subsequent reduction at temperatures at which the free energy of formation is zero or positive. Microstructural evidence confirm these conclusions.},

abstract = {Thin film platinum:palladium thermocouples were fabricated on alumina and mullite surfaces using radio frequency sputtering and characterized after high temperature exposure to oxidizing environments. The thermoelectric output, hysteresis, and drift of these sensors were measured at temperatures up to 1100 C. Auger electron spectroscopy was used to follow the extent of oxidation in each thermocouple leg and interdiffusion at the metallurgical junction. Minimal oxidation of the platinum and palladium thermoelements was observed after high temperature exposure, but considerable dewetting and faceting of the films were observed in scanning electron microscopy. An Arrhenius temperature dependence on the drift rate was observed and later attributed to microstructural changes during thermal cycling. The thin film thermocouples, however, did exhibit excellent stability at 1000 C with drift rates comparable to commercial type-K wire thermocouples. Based on these results, platinum:palladium thin film thermocouples have considerable potential for use in the hot sections of gas turbine engines. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The influence of temperature is regarded as particularly important for a structural health monitoring system based on ultrasonic guided waves. Since the temperature effect causes stronger signal changes than a typical defect, the former must be addressed and compensated for reliable damage assessment. Development of new temperature compensation techniques as well as the comparison of existing algorithms require high-quality benchmark measurements. This paper investigates a carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) plate that was fully characterized in previous research in terms of stiffness tensor and guided wave propagation. The same CFRP plate is used here for the analysis of the temperature effect for a wide range of ultrasound frequencies and temperatures. The measurement data are a contribution to the Open Guided Waves (OGW) platform: http://www.open-guided-waves.de . The technical validation includes initial results on the analysis of phase velocity variations with temperature and exemplary damage detection results using state-of-the-art signal processing methods that aim to suppress the temperature effect.},

abstract = {The fundamental circumferential shear horizontal (CSH0) wave is of practical importance in monitoring corrosion defects in large-diameter pipes due to its virtually non-dispersive characteristics. However, so far, there have been limited CSH0 wave transducers which can be used to constitute a structural health monitoring (SHM) system for pipes. Moreover, the CSH0 wave's capability of sizing the corrosion-like defect has not yet been confirmed by experiments. In this work, firstly, the mechanism of exciting CSH waves was analyzed. A method based on our previously developed bidirectional SH wave piezoelectric transducers was then proposed to excite the pure CSH0 mode and first order circumferential shear horizontal (CSH1) mode. Both finite element simulations and experiments show that the bidirectional transducer is capable of exciting pure CSH0 mode traveling in both circumferential directions of a 1-mm thick steel pipe from 100 to 300 kHz. Moreover, this transducer can also serve a sensor to detect CSH0 mode only by filtering circumferential Lamb waves over a wide frequency range from 100 to 450 kHz. After that, a method of sizing a rectangular notch defect by using CSH0 wave was proposed. Experiments on an 11-mm thick steel pipe show that the depth and circumferential extent of a notch can be accurately determined by using the proposed method. Finally, experiments were performed to investigate the reflection and transmission characteristics of CSH0 and CSH1 waves from notches with different depths. It was found that transmission coefficients of CSH0 mode decrease with the increasing of notch depth, which indicates that it is possible to monitor the depth change of corrosion defects by using CSH0 wave.},

abstract = {It has since long been known that surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices, resonators as well as delay lines, can be used as passive wireless sensors for physical quantities, like temperature and pressure, as well as gas sensors or identification-tags (ID-tags). The sensors are robust, work passively without a battery, can be applied at high temperatures, and provide a high resolution. Nevertheless, if the devices are used wirelessly in an industrial environment, several constraints have to be taken into account, especially when more than one quantity or device needs to be measured at the same time. The paper addresses the challenges that must be tackled when establishing multi-sensor-wireless-readout for industrial applications. Major issues here are the legal regulations for industrial, scientific and medical frequency bands (ISM-bands), as well as sampling time and costs, which impose severe restrictions to any system design. We describe several design approaches and their constraints. We successfully designed sensors based on reflective delay lines that allow the parallel readout of four independent temperature sensors in the 2.45 GHz ISM-band. These devices were fabricated and positively tested, demonstrating the applicability of SAW sensors for industrial applications.},

This work also describes the L(0, 1) and T(0, 1) mode transmission and reception in the bent waveguide for selecting an appropriate gauge length for the waveguide sensor. The range of temperature measurement is from room temperature to the maximum utility temperature of the pipe structure in a process industry. The change in time-of-fight of the reflected ultrasonic signal from the waveguide features (bend and notch) is used to measure the local temperature of the surrounding media.

Different approximate analytical approaches, employing Kirchhoff and Mindlin types of plate theories to describe the scattered field, are used. Good agreement between the experimental data and the analytical solutions is found within the ranges of validity of the different models. Introduction of a small imperfection, like a notch, at the boundary of the cavity changes the measured scattered field significantly.

Of the two practical methods by which temperature can be deduced from the emission [Heyes, A.L., Thermographic Phosphor Thermometry- Physical Principles and Measurement Capability, In: C.H. Sieverding, J.-F. Brouckaert (Eds.), VKI Lecture Series on Advanced Measurement Techniques for Aero and Stationary Gas Turbines. 2004, von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics, Brussels, (Vol. Lecture Series 2004-04)], the one considered herein relies on thermally activated non-radiative transitions from the excited to ground state making the decay rate in luminescence temperature dependent. The time constant of the exponential decay in luminescence can then be used to derive the temperature. The authors and co-workers have been working for some years now on the application of this method for condition monitoring and non-destruction evaluation in the hot sections of gas turbines. Turbine entry temperature is linked to efficiency and thereby to CO2 emissions so that there is a clear imperative to increase it. Current entry temperatures exceed the melting points of the metals from which local components such as combustion liners, nozzle guide vanes and turbine blades are made. Thermal management of these components is therefore critical to the operation of the engine and by implication sensors and instrumentation are required to aid the design of insulation and cooling schemes and to monitor their performance in service. Thermographic phosphors typically consisting of a ceramic host (e.g. YAG) with a rare-earth dopant are excellent candidates. These materials are stable at the required temperatures and the temperature dependence of their luminescence can provide a dynamic range that matches the expected environment. In this paper, the physics of the multi-phonon non-radiative decay process are reviewed and used to construct a simple design model for thermographic phosphors. Comparison with experimental data shows general agreement but there are several anomalous cases. These are reviewed and alternative thermal quenching mechanisms considered. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {There is a need to better understand the effect of temperature changes on the response of ultrasonic guided-wave pitch-catch systems used for structural health monitoring. A model is proposed to account for all relevant temperature-dependent parameters of a pitch-catch system on an isotropic plate, including the actuator-plate and plate-sensor interactions through shear-lag behavior, the piezoelectric and dielectric permittivity properties of the transducers, and the Lamb wave dispersion properties of the substrate plate. The model is used to predict the S0 and A0 response spectra in aluminum plates for the temperature range of -40-+60°C, which accounts for normal aircraft operations. The transducers examined are monolithic PZT-5A [PZT denotes Pb (Zr-Ti) O3] patches and flexible macrofiber composite type P1 patches. The study shows substantial changes in Lamb wave amplitude response caused solely by temperature excursions. It is also shown that, for the transducers considered, the response amplitude changes follow two opposite trends below and above ambient temperature (20°C), respectively. These results can provide a basis for the compensation of temperature effects in guided-wave damage detection systems. {\textcopyright} 2008 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract = {Ultrasonic Lamb wave techniques are widely used in a number of NDE applications. To excite Lamb waves, mode conversion of bulk waves or photoacoustic excitation often are used. Both of these approaches suffer from the need for liquid couplant or ablation of materials to reach a good signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we propose a novel technique that utilizes point source excitation and detection of Lamb waves through dry, elastic contacts to monitor velocity changes. A pair of pin transducers is used to excite and detect the A0 mode Lamb wave in the pipe wall, and the wave velocity is obtained by time-of-flight measurement. Any change in the pipe wall thickness can be detected by the change in the Lamb wave velocity due to the dispersive nature of the Ao mode. We demonstrate the power of this approach in ultrasonic pipe erosion/corrosion monitoring and its potential application in aircraft skin defect imaging. We present results of measurements of plate thickness and erosion/corrosion in a section of pipe that was removed from service, as well as imaging of defects in an aluminum thin plate. {\textcopyright} 1996 1996 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.},

abstract = {Ultrasonic temperature measurement allows for responsive measurements across an entire ultrasonic pathway, unlike most conventional temperature sensors that respond to the temperature at the point of their placement only after a notable response time. The high cost of required ultrasonic instrumentation can be reduced substantially by using ultrasonic oscillating temperature sensors (UOTS) consisting of inexpensive narrowband piezo transducers and driving electronics. An UOTS produces sustained oscillations at a frequency that relates to the temperature of the medium between the transducers. The existence of thermal hysteresis in UOTS readings, observed experimentally and apparently related to the fundamental properties of piezoelectric materials, makes conversion of the output frequency readings to the temperature values ambiguous. This makes it complicated to calibrate and use UOTS on their own. In the reported experiment (heating, then naturally cooling of a water vessel equipped with both UOTS and conventional sensors), this hysteresis was solved by fusing UOTS data with conventional temperature sensor readings. As the result, the combination of one UOTS plus one conventional reference sensor allowed improving both the temperature resolution and responsiveness of the latter and ambiguity of the readings of the former. Data fusion effectively led to calibrating the UOTS at every change of the conventional sensor's reading, removing any concerns related to the thermal expansion/contraction of the ultrasonic pathway itself and/or hysteresis of piezoelectric transducers.},

abstract = {An accelerated deposition test facility was used to study the relationship between film cooling, surface temperature, and particle temperature on deposit formation. Tests were run at gas turbine representative inlet Mach numbers (0.1) and temperatures (1090°C). Deposits were created from lignite coal fly ash with mass median diameters of 1.3 and 8.8um Two CFM56-5B nozzle guide vane doublets, comprising three full passages and two half passages of flow, were utilized as the test articles. Tests were run with different levels of film cooling back flow margin and coolant temperature. Particle temperature upon impact with the vane surface was shown to be the leading factor in deposition. Since the particle must traverse the boundary layer of the cooled vane before impact, deposition is directly affected by the film and metal surface temperature as well. Film coolant jet strength showed only minor effect on deposit patterns on the leading edge. However, larger Stokes number (resulting in higher particle impact temperature) corresponded with increased deposit coverage area on the showerhead region. Additionally, infrared measurements showed a strong correlation between regions of greater deposits and elevated surface temperature on the pressure surface. Thickness distribution measurements also highlighted the effect of film cooling by showing reduced deposition immediately downstream of cooling holes. Implications for engine operation in particulate-laden environments are discussed. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 by ASME.},

The oxidation of AlN, known to occur at these temperatures, had no significant effect on the ultrasonic transduction efficiency, but the difficulty to achieve high quality AlN single crystals limits their applications greatly.

abstract = {Time delay or the time-of-flight is a most frequently used parameter in many ultrasonic applications. Delay estimation is based on the sampled signal, so the resolution is limited by the sampling grid. Higher accuracy is available if the signal-to-noise ratio is high, then the subsample estimate is desired. Techniques used for subsample interpolation suffer from bias error. Time-of-flight estimation that is free from bias errors is required. The proposed subsample estimation works in the frequency domain; it is based on the cross-correlation peak temporal position. The phase of the cross-correlation frequency response becomes linear thanks to multiplication by the complex conjugate, and its inclination angle is proportional to the delay. Then, subsample interpolation becomes free from the bias error. Twelve algorithmic implementations of this technique have been proposed in this paper. All algorithmic implementations have been analyzed for bias and random errors using simulation and MATLAB codes are given as supplementary material. Comparison with best-performing interpolation techniques (spline approximation, cosine interpolation, carrier phase) is given for both bias and random errors. It was demonstrated that frequency domain interpolation has no bias errors, and noise performance is better or comparable to other subsample estimation techniques. Weighted regression using L2 norm minimization has the best performance: total errors (bias and random) are within 3{\%} of theoretical lower bound.},

abstract = {Purpose: Accurate measurements of the temperature distributions in hot section components are indispensable for the prognostic and health management of gas turbines. Thin film thermocouple (TFTC) sensors, directly fabricated on the surface of a component, add negligible mass and create little or no disturbance to airflow, and therefore, can provide accurate measurements of fast temperature fluctuations of gas turbines. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate TFTC sensors fabricated by combining pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and micromachining techniques (LM). Design/methodology/approach: The “dry” PLD/LM fabrication approach allows for excellent control of the chemical composition and physical characteristics of the constituent layers and their interfaces, thus achieving good adhesion of the layers to the substrate. Findings: The results of thermal cyclic durability testing of the fabricated TFTC sensors demonstrated that the proposed PLD-based approach can be used to fabricate sensors that are fully functional at temperatures up to 750°C. Analyses of the sensor performance during durability testing revealed: the existence of a threshold temperature below which accurate temperature measurements were achieved; an abrupt drop in the sensor output occurring when the sensor temperature exceeded the threshold value, with a fast recovery of the sensor output once the temperature was reduced below the threshold level; and sensor “training” capable of increasing the threshold value of the TFTC through its exposure to above-the-threshold temperatures. Originality/value: The work is the first time to demonstrate that simple PLD and LM processes can be used to fabricate TFTC that are fully functional at temperatures up to 750°C.},

abstract = {Although few studies on ultrasonic materials characterization present the expanded uncertainty, it is very important to quantify the final quality of the result. In addition, many of these studies do not mention the method used to estimate time delay, which is employed to calculate the longitudinal phase velocity (vTS). Therefore, the purpose of this study is to estimate the uncertainties of vTS values obtained by different time-delay estimation methods based on cross-correlation. In addition, computational simulation was used to validate the experimental results. The results of the computational simulation showed that when the sampling frequency is 50 MHz, the bias phase velocity was greater than 1.2 m{\textperiodcentered}s−1 for almost all time-delay estimation methods. Therefore, it is not advisable to use a sampling frequency less than or equal to 50 MHz. In all cases, the expanded uncertainty was below 3.5 m{\textperiodcentered}s−1. The statistical test results indicated a significant difference between the values of the longitudinal phase velocity estimated with a given method, as a function of the sampling frequency and the estimated velocity with each method as a function of the received bandwidth of transducer. The expanded uncertainty for phase velocity is intrinsically dependent on accurate speed of ultrasound estimation in the reference medium. The speed of ultrasound and temperature are correlated, therefore, precise estimation of the reference medium temperature is important to maintain the overall precision of the method employed in this study. The novelty of this work resides in the comparison of different time-delay estimation using measurement uncertainty as parameter. Furthermore, after the detailed step by step assessment of uncertainties for the dissimilar computational methods, one can easily estimate the uncertainty by his own using this paper as guidance.},

abstract = {The operating temperature of turbomachinery components are increasing the drive towards higher efficiency, lower fuel consumption and reduced emissions. Accurate thermal models are required to simulate the operating temperature of gas turbine components and hence predict service life or other qualities. These models require validation through measurement. Therefore, the quality of the models and prediction are dependent on the uncertainty of the measurements used to validate them. Currently available temperature measurement techniques have limitations in the harsh operating conditions inside gas turbines. Thermocouples are widely used, however, are practically very challenging to apply on rotating components and only provide point measurements. Furthermore, over 80{\%} of the surface must be measured to validate complex thermal models. A new technique under development called thermal history paints (THP) and coatings (THC) overcomes some of these limitations. While the uncertainty estimation model described in this work is directly related to THP, the principles can be applied in general to thermographic phosphors. The paint comprises a proprietary phosphor powder and a water-based silicate binder. The paint is applied to the surface of the test component. When the component is operated the paint records the maximum temperature of exposure across the complete surface of the component. After operation, the paint is read-out using automated instrumentation. The measurements are related to temperature through calibration to deliver a high-resolution temperature profile. An uncertainty model has been developed and described for the first time. The model assesses the uncertainty sources related to the generation of the calibration data and the measurement of the component. It has been applied to determine the uncertainty of the THP in the temperature range 400-750 °C. The estimated uncertainty in this case was, for most samples, ±3-6 °C (67{\%} confidence level). The maximum estimated uncertainty was ± 6.3 °C or ±13 °C for 67{\%} or 95{\%} confidence levels respectively. This is believed to be well within the uncertainty of thermal models and the requirements for temperature measurements in harsh environments on gas turbines. These results combined with the fact that the THP can record the temperature at many locations demonstrates that it is a very useful tool for the validation of thermal models and lifing predictions. The uncertainty model was validated by measuring separate test samples and comparing the temperature measured from the THP with the thermocouple data from the heat treatment. The difference was within ±7 °C and the uncertainty bounds determined by the model.},

The use of instrumentation for these applications remains very challenging.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), through the Aviation Safety Program (AVSP), has taken a lead role in the development of new sensor technologies and techniques for the in situ structural health monitoring of gas turbine engines. This paper presents a summary of key results and findings obtained from three different structural health monitoring approaches that have been investigated.

Of the two practical methods by which temperature can be deduced from the emission [Heyes, A.L., Thermographic Phosphor Thermometry- Physical Principles and Measurement Capability, In: C.H. Sieverding, J.-F. Brouckaert (Eds.), VKI Lecture Series on Advanced Measurement Techniques for Aero and Stationary Gas Turbines. 2004, von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics, Brussels, (Vol. Lecture Series 2004-04)], the one considered herein relies on thermally activated non-radiative transitions from the excited to ground state making the decay rate in luminescence temperature dependent. The time constant of the exponential decay in luminescence can then be used to derive the temperature. The authors and co-workers have been working for some years now on the application of this method for condition monitoring and non-destruction evaluation in the hot sections of gas turbines. Turbine entry temperature is linked to efficiency and thereby to CO2 emissions so that there is a clear imperative to increase it. Current entry temperatures exceed the melting points of the metals from which local components such as combustion liners, nozzle guide vanes and turbine blades are made. Thermal management of these components is therefore critical to the operation of the engine and by implication sensors and instrumentation are required to aid the design of insulation and cooling schemes and to monitor their performance in service. Thermographic phosphors typically consisting of a ceramic host (e.g. YAG) with a rare-earth dopant are excellent candidates. These materials are stable at the required temperatures and the temperature dependence of their luminescence can provide a dynamic range that matches the expected environment. In this paper, the physics of the multi-phonon non-radiative decay process are reviewed and used to construct a simple design model for thermographic phosphors. Comparison with experimental data shows general agreement but there are several anomalous cases. These are reviewed and alternative thermal quenching mechanisms considered. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Next, PWAS active sensing of various damage types in aluminum and composite structures are explored. PWAS transducers can successfully detect the simulated crack and corrosion damage in aluminum plates through the wavefield analysis, and the simulated delamination damage in composite plates through the damage imaging method. Finally, the novel use of PWAS transducers as acoustic emission (AE) sensors for in situ AE detection during fatigue crack growth is presented. The time of arrival of AE signals at multiple PWAS transducers confirms that the AE signals are originating from the crack, and that the amplitude decay due to geometric spreading is observed.},

Both one-port SAW resonator and one-port SPC resonator are fabricated on AlN/Sapphire. Frequency responses and quality factors are studied. The one-port SAW resonator has a fundamental resonance mode at 693.07 MHz. Unlike the one-port SAW resonator, the one-port SPC resonator has two distinct resonance modes at 680.28 MHz and 698.91 MHz, respectively. From the simulation results by finite element method (FEM), these two resonance modes may come from the two cavities of the one-port SPC resonator. Frequency-versus-temperature behaviors of these two resonators are investigated. The results show that the frequencies of resonance modes of these two resonators are decreased linearly with the increased temperature. A new kind of temperature sensor is proposed by using frequency difference between these two resonance modes of the one-port SPC resonator. The eventual temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) value of the temperature sensor is ppm °C-1 which is twice more than that of the one-port SAW resonator. All results prove that temperature sensitivity is enhanced by using two mode characters of one-port SPC resonator based on AlN/Sapphire.},

Thermographic phosphors enable many of the problems associated with the application of conventional thermometry techniques in a combustion environment to be overcome. They consist of a ceramic host matrix with a lanthanide ion dopant. When illuminated with UV light, they exhibit luminescence which is temperature dependent by virtue of variations in the relative intensities of distinct emission lines or in the time constant of the exponential decay that occurs once excitation has ceased. The authors have calibrated the response of a range of phosphors and demonstrated that a useful dynamic response exists up to at least 1400 °C. Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of the technique, surface temperatures have been measured over a small region within a model gas turbine combustor. In this region the temperature distribution was measured with an estimated uncertainty of ±10 K, with the absolute temperature values confirmed by thermocouple measurements within the experimental uncertainties of this technique.},

An electrical pulse applied across a transducer generates an extensional mode acoustic wave guided by the quartz pins. The extensional mode is converted into Lamb waves in the silicon wafer which acts as a plate waveguide. The Lamb waves propagate across the length of the silicon wafer and are converted back into an extensional mode in the opposite pin. The time of flight of the extensional mode in the quartz pins is measured using pulse echo techniques and is subtracted from the total time of flight to obtain the Lamb wave time of flight across the wafer.

Part II will focus on sensing involving other transduction mechanisms, including sensitivity to viscoelastic thin-film properties and polymer transitions, response mechanisms of polymer-coated vapor sensors, acoustoelectric and dielectric effects , and factors influencing sensor behavior in the liquid phase. We will begin Part II with a discussion of viscoelastic thin films. Acoustic devices are usually converted to chemical sensors by the application of a chemically selective layer (1). Polymer materials have been used in organic vapor sensing applications because vapor sorption in rubbery polymers is rapid and reversible ; polymers form adherent thin films; and selectivity can be tailored by varying the chemical structure. Before discussing vapor sensors in the next section, we will consider the inherent sensitivities of acoustic devices to the physical properties of viscoelastic thin films. This type of sensitivity was not noted in early models for TSM devices but was noted in early models for SAW sensors based on perturbation analysis (2, 3). These models predicted that the resonant frequency of a SAW device would be altered by both the mass and the shear modulus of a thin, nonconducting, isotropic film applied to its surface. Early studies confirmed that SAW devices were capable of detecting various polymer transitions (4). In recent years, a more complete picture of the effects of viscoelastic thin films on acoustic devices has emerged: Wave velocity and/or amplitude changes occur in response to polymer thermal expansion, polymer relaxation processes, and film resonance effects. Viscoelastic films have both elastic and viscous properties and can therefore store and dissipate mechanical energy. When subjected to shear forces, these properties are measured by the complex shear mod-ulus G, which has a real term G', that represents the storage (or elastic) modulus, and an imaginary term},

In this study, the main failure modes of turbines are reported. In particular, we focus on the turbine blades, turbine vanes and the transition ducts of the combustion chambers. The existing monitoring techniques for these components, with their own particular advantages and disadvantages, are summarised in this review. In addition to the vibrational approach, tip timing technology is the most used technique for blade monitoring. Several sensor types are appropriate for the extreme conditions in a gas turbine, but besides tip timing, other technologies are also very promising for future NDT/SHM applications.

abstract = {In this thesis ultrasonic Lamb wave measurements are performed to detect material nonlinearity in aluminum sheets. When a Lamb wave propagates, higher harmonic wave fields are generated and under certain conditions the second harmonic is cumulative. When these conditions hold the Lamb waves are serviceable for mate- rial nonlinearity measurements. For generation, a wedge–transducer combination is used. The detection of the Lamb wave are performed with either a laser interferom- eter or a second wedge–transducer combination and the results are benchmarked. A short–time Fourier transformation (STFT) is applied to the detected signal to extract the amplitudes of the first and second harmonics. A relative ratio of the first and second harmonics is deduced from nonlinear wave theory to assign the nonlinearity of the material. To verify the capability of the measurement setup and to show that cumulative second harmonics are generated, measurements for different propagation distances are performed. Further measurements on plasticly deformed specimens are carried out to examine the change of the material nonlinearity as a function of plas- ticity.},

abstract = {The operating temperatures of surfaces in the hot sections of gas turbines are of great practical importance, but are often very hard to measure. Thermal indicating paints offer one possible and practical way, but they have many disadvantages. A novel concept for the utilisation of phosphorescent coatings as thermal history sensors was proposed by Feist et al. [1] in 2007. These phosphor coatings undergo irreversible changes when exposed to high temperatures that affect their photoluminescent properties and are a function of both the temperature and duration of exposure. If care is taken to ensure steady state conditions during exposure, subsequent off-line analysis of emission in the laboratory can reveal the temperature experienced by the coating. In this paper, an investigation of the amorphous-to-crystalline change of Y 2SiO5:Tb is reported and used to provide a proof of concept for a phosphorescent thermal history sensor. Phosphor powder was calcined at different temperatures and for different periods, and characterised using photoluminescence spectroscopy. A calibration curve was generated and shows that this phosphor is suitable for temperature measurements over a temperature range from 600 ° C to at least 1000 °C. With more advanced signal processing routines it is anticipated that the dynamic range might be extended to 1400 °C. Such routines and other materials/physical processes are the subject of on-going research in the area at Imperial College and Southside Thermal Sciences. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This study presents a concerted approach developed for experimental measurement of surface temperature of critical aeroengine components using a non non-intrusive sensor that is compatible with structural integrity and endurance requirements of high temperature environments. Contrary to wire type thermocouples that cause structural degradation and aerodynamic disturbance in the flow path, the present study proposes a thin film thermocouple (TFTC) that is deposited using electron beam (E-beam) evaporation process. The basic experimentation and proof-of-concept studies are carried out to suit the deposition of K-Type TFTC on a turbine nozzle guide vane that is made of nickel based super alloy. The performance of TFTC is compared to that of wire type thermocouples. The Seebeck co-efficient of the developed K-Type TFTC is found to be 42 $\mu$V/°C, with a time constant and drift of 1.11784 ms and 0.4 °C/hour respectively. Based on the feasibility studies and characterization results of prototype TFTC, the deposition of similar TFTC was carried out on low pressure turbine nozzle guide vane (LPT NGV) of an aeroengine using same optimized parameters and procedures. The results presented vindicate the application of the proposed methodology for a developmental aero gas turbine engine.},

A complete wireless sensor system consists of such a SAW transponder and a local radar transceiver, is widely discussed. The antenna of the SAW transponder receives an RF burst in the VHF/UHF band transmitted by the radar transceiver. The reader unit performs a radar measurement of the impulse response of the SAW transponder via a high-frequency electromagnetic radio link. A temperature variation changes the SAW velocity and thereby the response pattern of the SAW device. By analyzing the time delay between backscattered pulses with different time delays we get a coarse estimation of the temperature of the SAW transponder. By using this information the ambiguity of ±2$\pi$ in the phase differences between the pulses can be eliminated, which provides to an overall temperature resolution of ±0.2°C.},

abstract = {In the chemical transport field, such as petro-chemicals or food processing, there is a need to quantify the spatially varying temperature and phase state of the material within a cylindrical vessel, such as a pipeline, using non-invasive techniques. Using ultrasonic signals, which vary in time-of-flight, intensity, and wave characteristics based on the temperature and phase of a material, an automated technique is presented which can provide a non-axisymmetric map of the phase and temperature inside a cylindrical vessel within a single plane using exclusively information from the through-transmission wave and the external temperature profile. This research demonstrates the approach using an amorphous wax, due to its stable nature and ability to be reheated many times without changing the properties of the wax. Due to its amorphous nature, the wax transitions from a solid to a low-viscosity fluid over a range of temperatures. This behavior is similar to that of a thermoplastic and a slurry experiencing curing. As the spatial temperature within a container of wax increases the time of flight for an ultrasonic signal will change. Results presented indicate the ability of the investigated technique to map the temperature and phase change of the wax based solely on the ultrasonic signals and knowledge of the external temperature on the outer edge of the vessel.},

abstract = {This investigation aimed to adapt the total focusing method (TFM) algorithm (originated from the synthetic aperture focusing technique in digital signal processing) to accommodate a circular array of piezoelectric sensors (PZT) and characterise defects using guided wave signals for the development of a structural health monitoring system. This research presents the initial results of a broader study focusing on the development of a structural health monitoring (SHM) guided wave system for advance carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) composite materials. The current material investigated was an isotropic (aluminium) square plate with 16 transducers operating successively as emitter or sensor in pitch and catch configuration enabling the collection of 240 signals per assessment. The Lamb wave signals collected were tuned on the symmetric fundamental mode with a wavelength of 17 mm, by setting the excitation frequency to 300 kHz. The initial condition for the imaging system, such as wave speed and transducer position, were determined with post processing of the baseline signals through a method involving the identification of the waves reflected from the free edge of the plate. The imaging algorithm was adapted to accommodate multiple transmitting transducers in random positions. A circular defect of 10 mm in diameter was drilled in the plate, which is similar to the delamination size introduced by a low velocity impact event in a composite plate. Images were obtained by applying the TFM to the baseline signals, Test 1 data (corresponding to the signals obtained after introduction of the defect) and to the data derived from the subtraction of the baseline to the Test 1 signals. The result shows that despite the damage diameter being 40 {\%} smaller than the wavelength, the image (of the subtracted baseline data) demonstrated that the system can locate where the waves were reflected from the defect boundary. In other words, the contour of the damaged area was highlighted enabling its size and position to be determined.},

abstract = {This thesis describes procedures and theory for a family of one-sided ultrasonic methods for determining third order elastic constants (TOEC) using sets of angle-beam wedges mounted on one side of a specimen. The methods are based on the well-known acoustoelastic effect, which is the change of wave speed with applied loads and is a consequence of the mechanical nonlinearity of a material. Increases in material nonlinearity have been correlated to the progression of damage, indicating that tracking changes in TOECs may provide a practical means of monitoring damage accumulation at the microstructural level prior to formation of macroscopic defects. Ultrasonic methods are one of the only ways to measure TOECs, and most prior techniques have utilized wave propagation paths parallel and perpendicular to the loading directions. A few additional ultrasonic techniques reported in the literature have employed oblique paths but with immersion coupling. These reported techniques are generally unsuitable for field implementation. The one-sided contact approach described here is applicable for in situ measurements of TOECs and thus lays the foundation for tracking of TOECs with damage. Theory is reviewed and further developed for calculating predicted velocity changes, and thus time shifts, as a function of uniaxial tensile loading for longitudinal, shear vertical, and shear horizontal waves in the context of angle-beam transducers mounted on the surface of the specimen. A comparison is made to published results where possible. The inverse problem of determining the three TOECs of an isotropic material from three measurements employing three different angle beam configurations is comprehensively analyzed. Four configurations providing well-posed solutions are identified and examined. A detailed sensitivity analysis is carried out to identify the best mounting configuration, wave mode combinations, refracted angles and geometry requirements for recovering the three TOECs. Two transducer mounting configurations are considered: (1) attached (glued-on) transducers potentially suitable for in situ monitoring, and (2) floating (oil-coupled) transducers potentially suitable for single measurements. Limited experimental results are presented for the attached case using two longitudinal measurements and one shear vertical measurement. The floating case experiments utilized three of the four well-posed solutions, and measurements were made on several aluminum alloys and low carbon steel. Key experimental issues are identified and discussed for both transducer mounting configurations.},

abstract = {It is desirable for any structural health monitoring (SHM) system to have maximum sensitivity with minimum sensor density. The structural health monitoring system described here is based on the excitation and reception of guided waves using piezoelectric elements as sensors. One of the main challenges faced is that in all but the most simple structures the wave interactions become too complex for the time domain signals to be interpreted directly. One approach to overcoming this complexity is to subtract a baseline reference signal from the measured system when it is known to be defect free. This strategy enables changes in the structure to be identified. Two key issues must be addressed to allow this paradigm to become a reality. First, the system must be sufficiently sensitive to small reflections from defects such as cracking. Second, it must be able to distinguish between benign changes and those due to structural defects. In this paper the baseline subtraction approach is used to detect defects in a simple rectangular plate. The system is shown to work well in the short term, and good sensitivity to defects is demonstrated. The performance degrades over the medium to long term. The principal reason for this degradation is shown to be the effect of change in temperature of the system. These effects are quantified and strategies for overcoming them are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The wafer itself is the most important and unpredictable variable in an RTP system, as its optical properties dominate its thermal response. Basic heat transfer models, which include the thermal radiative properties of wafers, have been used to evaluate several RTP temperature measurement and control schemes. Simple methods can deliver good repeatability in a production environment by relying on the integration of the wafer's spectral emissivity over a wide waveband.},

abstract = {This paper reports the feasibility of using an ultrasonic waveguide sensor for distributed temperature measurement in two different case studies, that is: 1) skin temperature of a solid structure (pipe) and 2) fluid (water). This technique improves upon the conventional multiple thermocouples approach for multi-level temperature measurements. The range of temperatures is from room temperature to maximum utility temperature for the two case studies (85 °C for water and 200 °C for pipe). Using the interaction of the propagating ultrasonic waves in a thin rodlike waveguide with intentionally designed geometric discontinuities (bends, axisymmetric, non-axisymmetric notches, and so on), the localized information on the temperature is extracted. An ultrasonic technique for accurate temperature measurement by tracking the time-of-flight of reflected guided wave modes from appropriately spaced notch reflectors is therefore proposed here, while using the reflection from a bend is used as a reference. Using a finite element model approach, the notch size and/or the bend radius were selected in order to reduce mode conversion effects as well as to obtain uniform amplitudes of the reflected signals from these designed discontinuities. The numerical results were experimentally validated for the L(0,1) wave mode using a stainless steel waveguide sensor. This paper is of interest to industrial applications including mould cooling jacket temperature monitoring during the steel manufacturing process as well as for furnace wall temperature measurements in petrochemical industries.},

abstract = {Operations and support (O{\&}S) expenses of the Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems account for 65-80{\%} of the total life cycle cost. One of the principal contributors to O{\&}S cost is the airframe maintenance process. The US Air Force airframes are maintained using the Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP). ASIP's goal is to ensure the desired level of structural safety, durability, and supportability with the least possible economic burden throughout the aircraft design service life. ASIP uses a schedule-based maintenance approach by establishing predefined maintenance intervals for performing manual inspections. This approach requires vehicles to be removed from service at predetermined times regardless of their actual condition. In most cases, inspections performed during this process do not find any damage, and the airframe is returned to service until the next inspection interval. In December 2007, the DoD implemented the "Condition-Based Maintenance Plus" policy. As the name indicates, the DoD plans to move toward a process that services weapon systems based on their actual condition instead of the presumptive schedule-based approach. As a result of this policy, an increased emphasis has been placed on the development of advanced health management technologies, such as structural health monitoring (SHM). An essential element of condition based maintenance is improved decision making.This chapter presents a recently developed method for improved decision making, the cognitive architecture for state exploitation (CASE). CASE is demonstrated in a laboratory simulation of an SHM task. The simulation is followed by a comparison of availability, reliability, and costs that result from CASE and ASIP-guided decisions. Although the CASE guided decisions in the SHM application show great potential benefits, it is a new technology which must be validated before it can be used in practice. The chapter concludes with a discussion regarding methods for the validation of SHM systems when maintenance decisions are aided by a progressive decision framework such as CASE.},

Thermal barrier coatings are currently been utilized in various engineering areas which include internal combustion engines, gas turbine blades of jet engines, pyrochemical reprocessing units and many more. The development of new materials, deposition techniques is targeted at improving the life of the underlying substrate. Hence, the performance of the coating plays a vital role in improving the life of substrate. The scope for advancement in thermal barrier coatings is very high and continuous efforts are being made to produce improved and durable coatings. Thermal barrier coatings have the potential to address long term and short-term problems in gas turbine, internal combustion and power generation industry. The study of thermal barrier coating material, performance and life estimation is a critical factor that should be understood to introduce any advancement. The present review gives an overview of the thermal spraying techniques and current advancements in materials, mechanical properties, understanding the high temperature performance, residual stress in the coating, understanding the failure mechanisms and life prediction models for coatings.

abstract = {Thermal paints are used by most aeronautical manufacturers in dedicated tests to record temperature profiles over the surface of engine components. The analysis of these coatings, which irreversibly change colour with temperature, is at present performed by a skilled operator who draws isothermal lines directly on the components surface. The technique suffers from a lack of accuracy and automation, as only some temperature levels can be determined and there is no convenient means to insert them in a 3D numerical description of the object. This paper first presents the characteristics and implementation of thermal paints. Two major advances are introduced regarding the image processing techniques developed to obtain temperature from colour and the use of a 3D scanner to digitize the outer shape of the components. The analysis is made quicker, more accurate and consistent than the former visual interpretation: temperature information is directly mapped on the 3D mesh and is ready for input in thermal models. The key points of the technique are discussed and illustrated by results on test pieces and turbine blades. {\textcopyright} 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The PXIe-567X-based signal generator can accurately generate not only conventional ON-OFF keying (OOK)-modulated or pulsed binary phase shift keying (BPSK)-modulated SAW RFID interrogation signals, but also completely user-defined interrogation signals. A custom LabVIEW user interface that allows to control the carrier frequency, the power, and the waveform of the interrogation signal has been designed. The operator can switch between custom waveforms without resetting and reprogramming the whole system. The proposed RFID request signal generator has been validated using a complete measurement setup. Time-domain and frequency-domain validation tests of OOK modulated and wideband pulsed BPSK-modulated signal generation have been conducted at 170, 340, 915 MHz and 2.45 GHz. Very accurate results have been obtained. The PXIe-567X-based RFID interrogator has been tested with a fabricated 3-b SAW RFID tag.

The present work concerns the upgrade of the finite volume CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamic) solver HybFlow, (see Adami et al.[1]) to simulate heat transfer in gas turbine cooling devices. In particular, the conjugate simulation of flow field heat transfer and metal heat conduction has been considered. To this aim, the original solver has been coupled to a routine solving the Fourier equation in solid domain. This modification allows the "conjugate heat transfer" investigation of heat transfer in fluid flow and solid domain simultaneously. The code has been validated through two different test-case applications. The first is a laminar flow over a flat plate, while the second is a film-cooled plate. Finally, a complete 3D film cooled NGV (Nozzle Guide Vane) has been investigated as an example for a more complex application. The simulation couples the thermal field inside the metal and the flow field in the vane, in the two plenum channels and in the six rows of cooling channels as well.},

Lamb waves were introduced to a stainless steel plate by the Nd:YAG pulsed laser at one point and detected by an AlN receiver at a distant position. The fundamental symmetric (S0) and antisymmetric (A0) Lamb waves generated by the pulsed laser were successfully detected by the AlN sensor. This detection was done on a stainless steel plate at temperatures ranging from room temperature to about 800 °C, with a signal-to-noise ratio of higher than 20 dB.

abstract = {Piezoelectric (PZT) ceramic elements are often subjected to complex loads during in-service lifetime in structural health monitoring (SHM) systems, and debonding of both excitation actuators and receiving sensors have a negative effect on the monitoring signals. A first systematic investigation of debonding behaviors by considering actuators and sensors simultaneously was performed in this paper. The debonding areas of actuators were set in different percentage range from 0{\%} to 70{\%}, and sensors in 0{\%}, 20{\%}, 40{\%} and 60{\%}. The signal-based monitoring method was used to extract the characteristic parameters of both the amplitudes and phases of received signals. Experimental results revealed that as the debonding areas of the actuators increase, the normalized amplitude appears a quick decrease before 35{\%} debonding area of actuators and then a slow rise until 60{\%} of debonding reached. This may be explained that the 35{\%} debonding turning point correspond to the coincidence of the excitation frequencies of peripheral actuators with the inherent frequency of the central piezoelectric sensor, and the 60{\%} be the result of the maximum ability of piezoelectric sensor. The degrees of debonding of actuators and sensors also have significant influence on the phase angle offset, with large debonding of actuators increases the phase offset sharply. The research work may provide useful information for practical monitoring of SHM systems.},

abstract = {The elastic moduli of high pressure treated supersaturated Al-Li solid solutions were measured. An interesting elastic behaviour was observed, in that, the bulk modulus decreased with an increase in the lithium content, whereas the Young's modulus and shear modulus increased. In order to clarify this property, we investigated the compressibility of the Al-Li supersaturated solid solutions prepared by high-pressure solid-solidification by high-pressure Synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The obtained pressure-volume relations were fitted to Birch's equation of state. The calculated bulk moduli were lower than those of pure Al at a reduction of about 0.6 GPa per mol{\%} Li. The temperature dependence of the elastic modulus for those supersaturated solid solutions was also measured, and it was found that the trend in the variation of the elastic modulus against the lithium concentration was maintained in the temperature range of 5-290 K. Therefore the attractive relationship between the bulk modulus and Young's modulus was demonstrated to be intrinsic. {\textcopyright} 1996 Chapman {\&} Hall.},

abstract = {As implied by its acronym, the quartz crystal microbalance was first used to determine the mass of material deposited on its surface. A heuristic description of the linear relation between the change in its resonant frequency $\Delta$f, from its unloaded resonant frequency f0, and the mass density, m, was recognized by Sauerbrey [1] and led to the now standard use of the QCM to measure mass deposition. This Sauerbrey relation is described by (Eq. 3.10): $\Delta$f =-2f02/√ $\rho$Q$\mu$Q m' (13.1) The coefficient preceding m is a fixed quantity, depending only on the parameters of the unloaded quartz. Using this relation, one can determine the mass density (kg/m2) deposited onto the QCM surface. Although the range of validity of Eq. (13.1) has limits, it has created a whole industry to measure deposition. From the single measurable of $\Delta$f, one can measure the single parameter m. As shown in Chaps. 3 and 14, it is possible to extract more information from the QCM. For example, when m exceeds certain values, Eq. (13.1) is no longer satisfied. A non-linear behavior is observed and the shape of the non-linearity can be used to extract information on elastic films concerning the shear modulus, G1, of the film (Chap. 14). This was put on a quantitative basis by Lu and Lewis in 1972 [2]. More recently, there are activestudies on the determination of many other parameters using the QCM. Some of the variables affecting the measurements have been recently cited by Lucklum [3]. Even for a simple example, when there is a viscoelastic film on the QCM and the quartz/film is immersed in a liquid, there are a number of parameters which are involved in QCM measurements. In addition to the quartz parameters, there are the density of the film $\rho$1, the shear storage modulus of the film G1, the shear loss modulus of the film G1, the thickness of the film h1, the density of the liquid $\rho$ 2, the shear loss modulus of the liquid G2 and the shear storage modulus of the liquid G2. It is clear that there are a large number of parameters that influence the behavior of the QCM. Most of the measurable to date have focused on two values, the change in frequency and the change in dissipation as the QCM is loaded. It is not possible to deconvolute these two variables into a determination of the materials parameters (see Chap. 14). Therefore, it is not surprising that additional measurements in conjunction with the QCM measurements are being undertaken to increase the number of measureables. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2008.},

abstract = {Over the past two decades the work on thermographic phosphors was mainly carried out in the US. It is only in recent years that other research groups have explored the field. However, in the future turbine inlet temperatures are likely to increase in order to achieve higher efficiencies introducing greater stress on the components and in particular the turbine blade coatings. Thus there is a general need for advanced temperature detection methods such as thermographic phosphors. When illuminated with UV light they exhibit luminescence, which is temperature dependent by virtue of variations in the relative intensities of distinct emission lines or in the time constant of the exponential decay, which occurs once excitation has ceased. Thermographic phosphors could be employed for temperature detection in the hot section of a gas turbine and this technique promises temperature detection of up to 1400 o C with uncertainties better than for other remote standard techniques such as pyrometry. The paper will address the instrumentation development over recent months and sources of uncertainty when the technique is applied in the field. The paper briefly reviews the application of thermographic phosphors for surface temperature measurements in laboratory combustor of realistic geometry and also includes calculations for the cooling effectiveness. Uncertainties in the temperature can be caused by the data fitting algorithms, fluctuations of the laser power, changes in oxygen pressure and different gain settings of the detector. When observing the target area through a flame additional radiation can cause a higher noise level than for calibration measurements hence leading to higher uncertainties in temperature. The uncertainties vary with temperature, but usually decrease at higher temperature due to the nature of the calibration data. Highest uncertainties in temperature measurements in the combustor were less than 3.7{\%} for 'cool' areas and less than 1{\%} for 'hot' areas. A simulation of the data detection and processing systems shows the dependencies of the uncertainties on particular input parameters such as noise, observation time, time resolution and digitalization of the signal. Phosphorescent processes can be pressure sensitive as was demonstrated for so called 'Pressure Sensitive Paints' (PSP) by a variety of research groups. PSPs are widely used for measuring pressure distributions on surfaces. They are sensitive to the partial pressure of oxygen adjacent to the PSP. Thus studies were carried out for two standard thermographic phosphors (Y 2 O 3 : Eu, YAG: Dy) to simulate pressure changes at different temperatures by changing the oxygen level to investigate the oxygen/pressure sensitivity of these materials. Initial data shows that there is a rather small effect of changing oxygen pressure on the luminescence lifetime decay of the phosphors. For a simulated pressure drop of 0.24bar maximum uncertainties in temperature due to oxygen pressure were estimated to be within 2{\%}.},

In this work, the elastic, dielectric, and piezoelectric constants of AlN single crystals were investigated at elevated temperatures up to 1000°C by the resonance method. We used resonators of five different modes to obtain a complete set of material constants of AlN single crystals. The electrical resistivity of AlN at elevated temperature (1000°C) was found to be greater than 5 × 1010 $\Omega${\textperiodcentered} cm. The resonance frequency of the resonators, which was mainly determined by the elastic compliances, decreased linearly with increasing temperature, and was characterized by a relatively low temperature coefficient of frequency, in the range of -20 to -36 ppm/°C. For all the investigated resonator modes, the elastic constants and the electromechanical coupling factors exhibited excellent temperature stability, with small variations over the full temperature range, {\textless}11.2{\%} and {\textless}17{\%}, respectively. Of particular significance is that due to the pyroelectricity of AlN, both the dielectric and the piezoelectric constants had high thermal resistivity even at extreme high temperature (1000°C). Therefore, high electrical resistivity, temperature independence of electromechanical properties, as well as high thermal resistivity of the elastic, dielectric, and piezoelectric properties, suggest that AlN single crystals are a promising candidate for high-temperature piezoelectric sensing applications.},

abstract = {The fascination for lanthanide optical spectroscopy dates back to the 1880s when renowned scientists such as Sir William Crookes, LeCoq de Boisbaudran, Eug{\`{e}}ne Demar{\c{c}}ay or, later, Georges Urbain were using luminescence as an analytical tool to test the purity of their crystallizations and to identify potential new elements. The richness and complexity of lanthanide optical spectra are reflected in an article published in 1937 by J.H. van Vleck: The Puzzle of Rare Earth Spectra in Solids. After this analytical and exploratory period, lanthanide unique optical properties were taken advantage of in optical glasses, filters, and lasers. In the mid-1970s, E. Soini and I. Hemmil{\"{a}} proposed lanthanide luminescent probes for time-resolved immunoassays (Soini and Hemmil{\"{a}} in Clin Chem 25:353–361, 1979) and this has been the starting point of the present numerous bio-applications based on optical properties of lanthanides. In this chapter, we first briefly outline the principles underlying the simplest models used for describing the electronic structure and spectroscopic properties of trivalent lanthanide ions LnIII (4f n ) with special emphasis on luminescence. Since the book is intended for a broad readership within the sciences, we start from scratch defining all quantities used, but we stay at a descriptive level, leaving out detailed mathematical developments. For the latter, the reader is referred to references Liu and Jacquier, Spectroscopic properties of rare earths in optical materials.

Some theoretical extension is provided which validates coherent addition of these overlapping resonances. Minor limitations shown are that the theory is inapplicable near grazing incidence and that it gives only a partial solution at incidence beyond the second critical angle when the frequency thickness product is the variable. Existing overlapping resonances theory is shown not to yield a unique relationship between the incident wave and a set of physical motions within the plate, and an approach to overcome this non-uniqueness is suggested. An equivalence is demonstrated between the 3 dB resonance half-width of each Lamb mode and the imaginary part of the modal wavenumber per unit wavenumber of the fluid, and this facilitates the numerical checking of the theory which is carried out in a companion paper [2] and yields convincing proof of the applicability of the approach. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

Simple techniques like thresholding, zero crossing or phase shift are discussed. For high accuracy measurements more advanced techniques are needed to exploit whole information contained in signal. Advanced techniques use maximum likelihood criteria for time position estimation. Likeness between the reference (transmitted) signal and received signal is analyzed here. A comparison of the correlation maximum, difference L1 norm minimum and difference L2 norm minimum techniques is given. Processing in digital domain introduces additional errors. Augmentation of the noise component of the Cramer-Rao equation accounting the analog-to-digital conversion influence (quantization and clock jitter) is presented. Estimate of the time of flight in digital domain is discrete. Subsample interpolated value can be obtained using sinc function, but usually truncated version is used.

abstract = {The aim of this paper was to develop a master-slave model with fluid-thermo-structure (FTS) interaction for the thermal fatigue life prediction of a thermal barrier coat (TBC) in a nozzle guide vane (NGV). The master-slave model integrates the phenomenological life model, multilinear kinematic hardening model, fully coupling thermal-elastic element model, and volume element intersection mapping algorithm to improve the prediction precision and efficiency of thermal fatigue life. The simulation results based on the developed model were validated by temperature-sensitive paint (TSP) technology. It was demonstrated that the predicted temperature well catered for the TSP tests with a maximum error of less than 6{\%}, and the maximum thermal life of TBC was 1558 cycles around the trailing edge, which is consistent with the spallation life cycle of the ceramic top coat at 1323 K.With the increase of pre-oxidation time, the life of TBC declined from 1892 cycles to 895 cycles for the leading edge, and 1558 cycles to 536 cycles for the trailing edge. The predicted life of the key points at the leading edge was longer by 17.7-40.1{\%} than the trailing edge. The developed master-slave model was validated to be feasible and accurate in the thermal fatigue life prediction of TBC on NGV.

abstract = {A nondestructive technique is described for the measurement of elastic constants of isotropic plates using ultrasonic Rayleigh-Lamb waves. The experimental method employs continuous harmonic waves and a pair of variable-angle contact transducers in pitch-catch mode. The phase velocity of the R-L waves at a particular frequency is determined from the phase shift over a measured path length. This simple experimental technique can measure phase velocity over the range 1-10 mm/$\mu$s with an error of less than 0.5{\%} over a frequency range of 50 kHz-2 MHz. Individual symmetric and antisymmetric modes can be generated through the selection of transducer angle and frequency. Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for the material are calculated from measurements of frequency and phase velocity by a nonlinear least squares solution to the dispersion equations. The sensitivity of the nonlinear least squares function to the measurement region of the dispersion curve is investigated. It was found that estimations of material properties are more accurate and less sensitive to small experimental errors when only selected frequencies and R-L modes are used in the least squares calculation. This technique is demonstrated with several isotropic materials and with both thick (6 mm) and thin (0.8 mm) plates. Values for elastic constants determined by the contact transducer Lamb wave technique compare favorably with values measured using the pulse-echo-overlap method. The uncertainty in measurements of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio was less than 1{\%} and 2{\%}, respectively. The technique has advantages over more traditional methods for measuring elastic properties when it is desirable to use wavelengths greater than the plate thickness, when properties may vary with frequency, or when it is necessary to measure in-plane elastic properties of thin plate structures. {\textcopyright} 1995 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.},

There are several condition monitoring techniques available to gas turbine users. Most publications tend to focus on a specific technique and do not address the need for integration of techniques. Several vibration problems that occur in gas turbines are manifestations of aerodynamic problems. To detect underlying problems of this nature, one is required to integrate performance, vibration and other condition monitoring data.

Solid stainless steel waveguides are used to provide well-defined and stable ultrasonic wave propagation paths. Ultrasonic wave velocity is strongly temperature dependent. The arrival times of the ultrasonic wavepackets along a waveguide are used to infer the average temperature of the waveguide. Our ultrasonic temperature measurements exhibit a high precision (i.e. ±0.015 °C) that is more than two times better than the quoted accuracy of 1/10 DIN resistance temperature detectors (RTDs). The responsiveness of the waveguides was also investigated. While ultrasonic measurements can be made at very high frequencies, the responsiveness is limited by the heat transfer into the active sensing area. The waveguides make it easy to customise the dimension of the active sensing area and a shorter response time than those of RTDs has been demonstrated. The technique presented in this paper is a robust and cost effective alternative to other contact temperature measurements.},

abstract = {Piezoelectric wafer active sensors (PWAS) are inexpensive, non-intrusive un-obtrusive devices that can be surface-mounted on existing structures, or inserted in a new composite structure. The PWAS can be used in both active and passive modes. In active mode, the PWAS generate Lamb waves that can exist as either traveling waves or standing waves. As traveling waves, PWAS-generated Lamb waves can be used with the pitch-catch, pulse-echo, or phased-array methods that arrow far-field and some medium-field damage detection. As standing waves, PWAS-generated Lamb waves can used in conjunction with the electro-mechanical (E/M) impedance technique that allows near field and some medium-field damage detection. This paper presents new results obtained in the use of PWAS for the structural health monitoring of aerospace vehicles. One set of results to be presented will refer to experiments performed on detection the crack propagation in a fracture-mechanics panel with a stress-concentration precrack in the center. The crack was propagated using cyclic fatigue loading in a large testing machine. The crack was imaged with the PWAS EUSR method, which is the guided Lamb wave equivalent of the P-wave C-scan, only that it is produced from a single location and does not need a raster x-y coverage like the conventional P-wave C-scan. PWAS EUSR measurements were taken while the testing machine was running, thus simulating in-service monitoring conditions. Another set of results refers to the PWAS monitoring of disbonds in an spacecraft panel. The E/M impedance technique is shown to distinguish clearly between a bonded and disbonded part. The E/M impedance of bonded part measured at different locations is shown to be consistently the same, with the actual curves overlapping, thus confirming that the impedance changes noticed at the disbonded location are solely due to disbonding.},

The results show that the thermal expansion coefficients, yield strengths, and elastic moduli played key roles in determining the magnitude of plastic strains. To produce a certain plastic strain, the temperature difference increased with decreasing temperature. It means that the cooling rates at high temperatures play an important role in determining residual stresses. Only reducing the cooling rate at low temperatures does not reduce residual stresses. An optimized quenching process can minimize the residual stresses and guarantee superior mechanical properties. In the quenching process, the cooling rates were low at temperatures above 450 °C and were high at temperatures below 400 °C.},

Test procedures were based on the theory discussed in Part 1 to enhance accuracy and to estimate confidence intervals. In particular, the method employed at high temperature was calibrated at room temperature by comparing the results with those obtained by methods with low sensitivity to layer thicknesses. For the bond coat, Young's modulus was found to be temperature independent up to about 500°C; a decreasing trend was observed above this temperature. For the top coat, a slightly decreasing Young's modulus was observed over the whole temperature range examined. A possible explanation is given on the basis of phase transformation and the microstructure of the two layers. At room temperature, Poisson's ratio for the bond coat was found to be near 0.3, whereas a near zero value was measured for the top coat.},

The reasons for using the S 0 mode are discussed and it is shown how the choice of mode determines the nature of the EMAT array elements. A novel array construction technique is shown to be necessary whereby the EMAT coils for adjacent elements are overlapped in order to achieve the required element density. Results are presented that illustrate the operation of the device on steel and aluminum plate specimens in the thickness range from 5 to 10 mm. An area of at least 10 m2 can be inspected from a single location. Spurious signals in the results are caused both by the unwanted A0 mode and by S0 sidelobes, the latter occurring at the same radial distance from the array as the genuine S0 signal from a reflector, but in the wrong direction. The signal-to-coherent noise performance of the complete system is determined by the amplitude ratio of the largest genuine S0 signal to the largest spurious signal. This is typically around 30 dB. The sensitivity of the device to artificial defects and genuine corrosion patches is demonstrated and the limitations of its operation are discussed. The feasibility of using the device with the S1 guided wave mode to inspect a 20 mm thick plate is also demonstrated. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

abstract = {Damage detection techniques have been proposed to exploit changes in modal parameters and to identify the extent and location of damage in large structures. Most of such techniques, however, generally neglect the environmental effects on modal parameters. Such environmental effects include changes in loads, boundary conditions, temperature, and humidity. In fact, the changes due to environmental effects can often mask more subtle structural changes caused by damage. This paper examines a linear adaptive model to discriminate the changes of modal parameters due to temperature changes from those caused by structural damage or other environmental effects. Data from the Alamosa Canyon Bridge in the state of New Mexico were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive filter for this problem. Results indicate that a linear four-input (two time and two spatial dimensions) filter to temperature can reproduce the natural variability of the frequencies with respect to time of day. Using this simple model, we attempt to establish a confidence interval of the frequencies for a new temperature profile in order to discriminate the natural variation due to temperature.

abstract = {Lamb waves are commonly modelled in isotropic metals such as steel and aluminium which have well-known published properties. When attempting to model Lamb waves in polymer materials with viscoelastic properties such as epoxy adhesives, it is not sufficient to rely on published properties which are usually based on quasi-static mechanical testing. This is due to Lamb waves creating an elastic disturbance with a relatively low strain amplitude but high strain rate. Unlike in metals, the modulus of a viscoelastic material is dependent on strain rate. Therefore to accurately model the behaviour of Lamb waves in polymers, the properties of the host structure must be obtained using methods that reproduce the strain amplitudes and strain rates of the intended application. This paper presents an investigation of three ultrasonic methods for determining the material properties of a film adhesive. It is found that the elastic modulus required to accurately model Lamb waves in this adhesive is approximately 60{\%} higher than the value determined by conventional quasi-static testing. Finally, a Lamb wave simulation is used to illustrate that such discrepancies can lead to significant differences in the scattered wave field from a bond-line defect.},

abstract = {Ultrasonic guided waves are used extensively when checking for defects in petrochemical and other industries and are mostly generated using piezoelectric transducers on an angled wedge or electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) in different configurations. Low-frequency inspection allows for long-distance propagation, but it is best suited for detecting relatively large defects, while at higher frequencies, the presence of multiple wave modes limit defect detectability, so achieving practical single Lamb mode excitation via careful transduction is very beneficial. This paper investigates the relative ability of angled piezoelectric and meander coil EMAT probes to produce single-mode transduction in the medium (1-5 MHz-mm) and high ({\textgreater}5 MHz-mm) frequency-thickness regions of the dispersion curves. The nature of each transducer is studied analytically by simulating the corresponding surface forces, followed by the use of a Fourier transform in time and space (2-D fast Fourier transform) to highlight the excitation region in the wavenumber-frequency space. With angled wedge excitation there is a linear relationship between the excitation frequency and the wavenumber which means that the excitation tends to track typical dispersion curves, allowing for easier pure mode generation. In contrast, the EMAT controls frequency and wavenumber separately which makes it more difficult to generate a pure mode when dispersion curves are close together; however, by narrowing the frequency bandwidth via a large number of cycles in the excitation signal, pure mode generation via an EMAT was shown to be possible even in areas of closely spaced modes. As example cases, analytical results, backed up by experiments, showed that signals dominated by the A0 mode at 1.5 MHz-mm and also the A1 mode at 18 MHz-mm can be generated with both angled piezoelectric and EMAT probes.},

The sizes of damage zones were found in good agreement for both techniques employed. The presence of a polymer film on the sample surface has been shown to be useful in detecting the impact damage. Air-coupled C-scan technique was selected for defect size estimation in further studies of impact and post-impact response of hybrid laminates for naval structures. Reinforcements of carbon and glass, woven Kevlar/carbon and Kevlar/glass fabrics have been studied. Minor differences in post-impact compression performance of laminates, in which carbon fibres have been partly replaced by glass fibres, may indicate that regarding the impact behaviour, carbon fibre laminates can be safely replaced by cheaper carbon/glass or Kevlar glass laminates and woven Kevlar/carbon laminates by Kevlar/glass ones. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper reports the feasibility of using an ultrasonic waveguide sensor for distributed temperature measurement in two different case studies, that is: 1) skin temperature of a solid structure (pipe) and 2) fluid (water). This technique improves upon the conventional multiple thermocouples approach for multi-level temperature measurements. The range of temperatures is from room temperature to maximum utility temperature for the two case studies (85 °C for water and 200 °C for pipe). Using the interaction of the propagating ultrasonic waves in a thin rodlike waveguide with intentionally designed geometric discontinuities (bends, axisymmetric, non-axisymmetric notches, and so on), the localized information on the temperature is extracted. An ultrasonic technique for accurate temperature measurement by tracking the time-of-flight of reflected guided wave modes from appropriately spaced notch reflectors is therefore proposed here, while using the reflection from a bend is used as a reference. Using a finite element model approach, the notch size and/or the bend radius were selected in order to reduce mode conversion effects as well as to obtain uniform amplitudes of the reflected signals from these designed discontinuities. The numerical results were experimentally validated for the L(0,1) wave mode using a stainless steel waveguide sensor. This paper is of interest to industrial applications including mould cooling jacket temperature monitoring during the steel manufacturing process as well as for furnace wall temperature measurements in petrochemical industries.},

abstract = {The paper aims to develop improved acoustic-based structural health monitoring (SHM) and nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques, which provide the waves directivity emitted by the angle beam wedge actuators in thin-walled structures made of plastic materials and polymeric composites. Our investigation includes the dispersive analysis of the waves that can be excited in the studied plastic panel. Its results allowed to find two kinds of generated acoustic waves—anti-symmetric Lamb waves (A0) and shear horizontally polarized SH waves (SS0). The bounds of the chosen frequency range for the experimental and numerical studies were accepted as a compromise between the desire to obtain a high defect resolution by generating short waves, their adjustable directivity, and maximum propagation length. The finite element model for the transducer was built by using the results of an actuator structure experimental study. The frequency response functions for the actuator current and oscillation amplitude of the footprint surface demonstrated good agreement. The found eigenfrequencies of the actuator's structure were used for the numerical and experimental study of the Lamb and SH wave generation and propagation in a thin-walled plastic panel. Our results convincingly demonstrated the satisfactory directivity of the actuated waves at their excitation on the frequencies that corresponded to the natural modes of the actuator oscillation. The authors assume that an efficient use of the proposed technique for other analyzed quasi-isotropic materials and applied actuators can be provided by preliminary research using a similar approach and methods presented in this article.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) using guided waves is one of the only ways in which damage anywhere in a structure can be detected using a sparse array of permanently attached sensors. To distinguish damage from structural features, some form of comparison with damage-free reference data is essential, and here subtraction is considered. The detectability of damage is determined by the amplitude of residual signals from structural features remaining after the subtraction of reference data. These are non-zero due to changing environmental conditions such as temperature. In this paper, the amplitude of the residual signals is quantified for different guided-wave SHM strategies. Comparisons are made between two methods of reference signal subtraction and between two candidate sensor configurations. These studies allow estimates to be made of the number of sensors required per unit area to reliably detect a prescribed type of damage. It is shown that the number required is prohibitively high, even in the presence of modest temperature fluctuations, hence some form of temperature compensation is absolutely essential for guided-wave SHM systems to be viable. A potential solution is examined and shown to provide an improvement in signal suppression of approximately 30dB, which corresponds to two orders of magnitude reduction in the number of sensors required. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Inspection for corrosion and pitting defects in the petrochemical industry is vital and forms a significant fraction of the operating expenditure. Low frequency guided wave inspection is frequently employed as it gives large area coverage from a single transducer position. However, detection becomes problematic at inaccessible regions such as pipe supports or beyond T-joints since the low frequency guided waves produce a significant reflection from the feature itself, hence limiting the defect detectability of the method. This suggests testing at higher frequencies which helps to minimise the reflection from the feature and also improves the sensitivity to smaller defects. There are a number of guided wave and related techniques implemented for corrosion inspection including the S0 mode (at ∼ 1 MHz-mm), SH0 and SH1 modes (at ∼ 3 MHz-mm), CHIME, M-skip and Higher Order Mode Cluster (A1 mode at ∼ 18 MHz-mm). This paper presents a systematic analysis of the defect detection performance of each method with sharp and gradual defects, as well as their sensitivity to attenuative coatings, liquid loading, surface roughness and ability to test beyond features such as T-joints. It is shown by finite element analysis backed up by experiments that the A1 mode provides the best overall performance when dealing with surface features such as T-joints and coatings because of its low surface motion. Additionally a combination of two or more methods is suggested for corrosion inspection at inaccessible locations: The A1 mode in reflection for severe, sharp, pitting type defects; long range guided waves in reflection for large-area thinning and the SH1 mode in transmission for shallow, gradual defects.},

abstract = {A novel approach that uses noninvasive ultrasound to measure the temperature distribution in solid materials is described and validated in high-temperature laboratory experiments. The approach utilizes an ultrasound propagation path with naturally occurring or purposefully introduced echogenic features that partially redirect the energy of an ultrasound excitation pulse back to the transducer, resulting in a train of echoes. Their time of flight depends on the velocity of ultrasound propagation, which changes with temperature distribution in different segments of the propagation path. We reconstruct segmental temperature distributions under different parameterizations. Several parameterizations are discussed, including piecewise constant and piecewise linear, and the parametrization that requires that the estimated temperature profile satisfies an appropriate heat conduction model. The experimental validation of the proposed approach with an alumina sample shows that even with simple parameterizations, the temperature profile is correctly captured with an accuracy that may be comparable to that of the traditional pointwise sensors. The advantages of the approach are discussed, including its suitability for real time and non-destructive temperature measurements in extreme environments and locations inaccessible to the traditional insertion sensors.},

abstract = {Advanced thin film sensor techniques that can provide accurate surface strain and temperature measurements are being developed at NASA Lewis Research Center. These sensors are needed to provide minimally intrusive characterization of advanced materials (such as ceramics and composites) and structures (such as components for Space Shuttle Main Engine, High Speed Civil Transport, Advanced Subsonic Transports and General Aviation Aircraft) in hostile, high-temperature environments, and for validation of design codes. This paper presents two advanced thin film sensor technologies: strain gauges and - thermocouples. These sensors are sputter deposited directly onto the test articles and are only a few micrometers thick; the surface of the test article is not structurally altered and there is minimal disturbance of the gas flow over the surface. The strain gauges are palladium-13{\%} chromium based and the thermocouples are platinum-13{\%} rhodium vs. platinum. The fabrication techniques of these thin film sensors in a class 1000 cleanroom at the NASA Lewis Research Center are described. Their demonstration on a variety of engine materials, including superalloys, ccramics and advanced ceramic matrix composites, in several hostile, high-temperature test environments are discussed.},

abstract = {Thin film platinum:palladium thermocouples were fabricated on alumina and mullite surfaces using radio frequency sputtering and characterized after high temperature exposure to oxidizing environments. The thermoelectric output, hysteresis, and drift of these sensors were measured at temperatures up to 1100 C. Auger electron spectroscopy was used to follow the extent of oxidation in each thermocouple leg and interdiffusion at the metallurgical junction. Minimal oxidation of the platinum and palladium thermoelements was observed after high temperature exposure, but considerable dewetting and faceting of the films were observed in scanning electron microscopy. An Arrhenius temperature dependence on the drift rate was observed and later attributed to microstructural changes during thermal cycling. The thin film thermocouples, however, did exhibit excellent stability at 1000 C with drift rates comparable to commercial type-K wire thermocouples. Based on these results, platinum:palladium thin film thermocouples have considerable potential for use in the hot sections of gas turbine engines. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The increasing trend towards high-temperature, fuel efficient jet engines has led to the development of complex cooling schemes for the turbine blades. The measurement of temperature of the blade during operation, which is accomplished in conventional blade design by embedding wire thermocouples in the blade wall, causes serious structural and aerodynamic problems in the case of cooled turbines. In order to meet the requirement of temperature measurement in cooled turbines, it is desirable to develop surface-mounted thin-film thermocouples or a resistance thermometer. In the current state of the art of thin-film thermocouples, the sensing element consists of 2-$\mu$m-thick Pt and Pt 10{\%} Rh thin-film elements deposited on the insulating surface of the blades and vanes. The insulator is developed by thermal oxidation of a MCrAlY coating which is deposited on the blade and vane surface in the current state of turbine technology. The understanding of the structural and thermoelectric stability of the sensor elements and of the insulating layer of A1 2 O 3 in the hostile environment of a gas turbine requires an in-depth study of the metallurgical reactions occurring at the thin-film A1 2 O 3 and Al 2 O 3 -MCrAlY interfaces and of the corrosive reactions on the surface of the metal film. The work presented in this review addresses the problems associated with obtaining highly adherent and insulating A1 2 O 3 on the MCrAlY surfaces, adhesion of the sensor elements, thermoelectric stability of the sensors on contamination, and finally the development of a corrosion protection coating. The desired quality A1 2 O 3 has been grown on NiCoCrAlY-coated nickel-based superalloy substrates by a combination of oxidation treatments. The interface-modified Pt and Pt/Rh films are deposited on the oxide by a dc magnetron sputtering technique. The corrosion protection requirements involve deposition of Si-O-N and Si 3 N 4 graded structures on the sensors by the plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition process. Details of the electrical and metallurgical characteristics of the device at each stage of the coating/film growth have been analyzed by a number of surface sensitive and bulk analytical techniques. {\textcopyright} 1986, American Vacuum Society.

abstract = {Different guided wave mode has different sensitivity to the defects of rail head, rail web and rail base in the detection of rail defects using ultrasonic guided wave. A novel guided wave mode selection and excitation method is proposed, which is effective for detection and positioning of the three parts of rail defects. Firstly, the mode shape data in a CHN60 rail is obtained at the frequency of 35 kHz based on SAFE method. The guided wave modes are selected, combining the strain energy distribution diagrams with the phase velocity dispersion curves of modes, which are sensitive to the defects of the rail head, rail web and rail base. Then, the optimal excitation direction and excitation node of the modes are calculated with the mode shape matrix. Phase control and time delay technology are employed to achieve the expected modes enhancement and interferential modes suppression. Finally, ANSYS is used to excite the specific modes and detect defects in different rail parts to validate the proposed methods. The results show that the expected modes are well acquired. The selected specific modes are sensitive to the defects of different positions and the positioning error is small enough for the maintenance staff to accept.},

For identification purposes, a SAW transponder picks up an electromagnetic request signal and stores it until all echoes caused by multipath propagation have died away.

abstract = {Ultrasonic transducers performance can be seriously deteriorated by loss of adhesion between some constitutive elements such as the active element, the backing, or the matching layer. In the present work, the influence of bonding delaminations on the performance of a single-element ultrasonic transducer, which is composed of a piezoelectric disk, a backing, and a matching layer, is studied numerically and experimentally. Based on the positions between layers, two cases, i.e., delaminations between ceramic and backing or between ceramic and matching layer, are considered. Each case involves three different types of delaminations, which are marked as delamination type (DT)-I, II, and III. DT-I, a circular shape delamination, starts from the center and expands towards the peripheric zone; DT-II, an annular shape delamination, starts from the peripheric zone and expands towards the center; DT-III is a sector shape delamination with a given angle. The numerical simulations are performed by the finite element method and the influence of delaminations on the electromechanical admittance (EMA) of the transducer is investigated. 3D printed backings and matching layers are mounted on a PZT sample to assemble delaminated single-element transducers. An impedance analyzer is used for experimental measurements. Comparison between numerical and experimental results shows a reasonable agreement making changes in EMA an interesting indicator to inform about the occurrence and severity of delaminations in a single-element ultrasonic transducer.},

abstract = {Baseline subtraction is commonly used in guided wave structural health monitoring to identify the signal changes produced by defects. However, before subtracting the current signal from the baseline, it is essential to compensate for changes in environmental conditions such as temperature between the two readings. This is often done via the baseline stretch method that seeks to compensate for wave velocity changes with temperature. However, the phase of the signal generated by the transduction system is also commonly temperature sensitive and this effect is neglected in the usual compensation procedure. This article presents a new compensation procedure that deals with both velocity and phase changes. The results with this new method have been compared with those obtained using the standard baseline stretch technique on both a set of experimental signals and a series of synthetic signals with different coherent noise levels, feature reflections, and defect sizes, the range of noise levels and phase changes being chosen based on initial experiments and prior field experience. It has been shown that the new method both reduces the residual signal from a set baseline and enables better defect detection performance than the conventional baseline signal stretch method under all conditions examined, the improvement increasing with the size of the temperature and phase differences encountered. For example, in the experimental data, the new method roughly halved the residual between baseline and current signals when the two signals were acquired at temperatures 15°C apart.},

Firstly, SAW sensors of each cut with 50 different layouts were designed and fabricated according to the calculated SAW velocity, and a general wireless measurement platform was setup. Secondly, under the same test conditions, Q factor, temperature sensitivity and decaying waves of these sensors were tested, and along with the calculated temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF), these parameters were finally compared respectively. After comparison, the conclusions are as follows: LiNbO3 sensors had higher temperature sensitivity, and showed superiority without the limitation of distance in wireless measurements, while quartz sensors performed well when the distance increased, and this suggests they can be applied to long distance sensing for their high Q factor even the sensitivity is moderate. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

The methods are: infrared pyrometry, Raman spectroscopy, and photo-stimulated luminescence from lanthanide-doped coatings. Although each has the capability of measuring temperatures pertinent to monitoring TBCs, the finite thickness of typical coatings together with the optical properties of zirconia place severe restrictions on the depth from which the temperature sensing can be obtained. Some of these limitations can be circumvented using photo-stimulated luminescence with coatings containing dopants at specific locations. To illustrate this, it is demonstrated that by depositing coatings with a lanthanide dopant, such as Eu3+, at specific locations, for instance in contact with the metallic alloy, temperature sensing can be performed with much higher spatial resolution. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Ceramic Society.},

Dispersion compensation can be achieved by the following steps: relative wavenumber measurement, traveling distance estimation, phase compensation, and wave correction. The feasibility of $\Delta$K-DC with the theoretical wavenumber and measured wavenumber was validated with a high-dispersive A0 mode in a 2 mm steel plate experiment. The results showed that phase spectrum measurement was an effective method to construct the wavenumber curve, the propagation distances estimated by SAP2 were very accurate, and the dispersive signals can be compensated perfectly by applying the phase compensation and wave correction methods for each wavepacket. The present results highlight the application of $\Delta$K-DC on dispersion compensation without any material parameters of a waveguide.},

FE analyses with both part and through thickness holes at different relative positions are presented, and are a step towards estimation of the scattering behaviour of multiple and random defects. The validity of employing the superposition technique in estimating reflection coefficients is assessed. Results show that the reflection coefficient for the T(0,1) mode is dependent on absolute frequency and axial separation, and independent of circumferential position. Employing superposition is found to be valid down to defect centre to centre separation distances of two diameters in the worst case, with improved validity with shallower defects.

abstract = {Ultrasonic Lamb wave techniques are widely used in a number of NDE applications. To excite Lamb waves, mode conversion of bulk waves or photoacoustic excitation often are used. Both of these approaches suffer from the need for liquid couplant or ablation of materials to reach a good signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we propose a novel technique that utilizes point source excitation and detection of Lamb waves through dry, elastic contacts to monitor velocity changes. A pair of pin transducers is used to excite and detect the A0 mode Lamb wave in the pipe wall, and the wave velocity is obtained by time-of-flight measurement. Any change in the pipe wall thickness can be detected by the change in the Lamb wave velocity due to the dispersive nature of the Ao mode. We demonstrate the power of this approach in ultrasonic pipe erosion/corrosion monitoring and its potential application in aircraft skin defect imaging. We present results of measurements of plate thickness and erosion/corrosion in a section of pipe that was removed from service, as well as imaging of defects in an aluminum thin plate. {\textcopyright} 1996 1996 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.},

abstract = {A nondestructive technique is described for the measurement of elastic constants of isotropic plates using ultrasonic Rayleigh-Lamb waves. The experimental method employs continuous harmonic waves and a pair of variable-angle contact transducers in pitch-catch mode. The phase velocity of the R-L waves at a particular frequency is determined from the phase shift over a measured path length. This simple experimental technique can measure phase velocity over the range 1-10 mm/$\mu$s with an error of less than 0.5{\%} over a frequency range of 50 kHz-2 MHz. Individual symmetric and antisymmetric modes can be generated through the selection of transducer angle and frequency. Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for the material are calculated from measurements of frequency and phase velocity by a nonlinear least squares solution to the dispersion equations. The sensitivity of the nonlinear least squares function to the measurement region of the dispersion curve is investigated. It was found that estimations of material properties are more accurate and less sensitive to small experimental errors when only selected frequencies and R-L modes are used in the least squares calculation. This technique is demonstrated with several isotropic materials and with both thick (6 mm) and thin (0.8 mm) plates. Values for elastic constants determined by the contact transducer Lamb wave technique compare favorably with values measured using the pulse-echo-overlap method. The uncertainty in measurements of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio was less than 1{\%} and 2{\%}, respectively. The technique has advantages over more traditional methods for measuring elastic properties when it is desirable to use wavelengths greater than the plate thickness, when properties may vary with frequency, or when it is necessary to measure in-plane elastic properties of thin plate structures. {\textcopyright} 1995 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.},

abstract = {The objective of the EU project “Sensors Towards Advanced Monitoring and Control of Gas Turbine Engines (acronym STARGATE)” is the development of a suite of advanced sensors, instrumentation and related systems in order to contribute to the developing of the next generation of green and efficient gas turbine engines. One work package of the project deals with the design and development of a long wavelength infrared (LWIR) radiation thermometer for the non-contact measurement of the surface temperature of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) during the operation of gas turbine engines. For opaque surfaces (e.g. metals or superalloys) radiation thermometers which are sensitive in the near or short wavelength infrared are used as state-of-the-art method for non-contact temperature measurements. But this is not suitable for oxide ceramic based TBCs (e.g. partially yttria stabilized zirconia) as oxide ceramics are semi-transparent in the near and short wavelength infrared spectral region. Fortunately the applied ceramic materials are non-transparent in the long wavelength infrared and additionally exhibit a high emittance in this wavelength region. Therefore, a LWIR pyrometer can be used for non-contact temperature measurements of the surfaces of TBCs as such pyrometers overcome the described limitation of existing techniques. For performing non-contact temperature measurements in gas turbines one has to know the infrared-optical properties of the applied TBCs as well as of the hot combustion gas in order to properly analyse the measurement data. For reaching a low uncertainty on the one hand the emittance of the TBC should be high ({\textgreater}0.9) in order to reduce reflections from the hot surrounding and on the other hand the absorbance of the hot combustion gas should be low ({\textless}0.1) in order to decrease the influence of the gas on the measured signal. This paper presents the results of the work performed by the authors with focus on the implementation of the LWIR pyrometer and the selection of the optimal wavelength band where the detector should be sensitive. Besides determining the spectral infrared-optical properties (emittance, transmittance and absorbance) of the TBCs and the hot combustion gas at high temperatures up to 1700 K, the wavelength specification of the developed LWIR pyrometer is defined. Also an overview of the LWIR radiation thermometer is given and the preliminary results for different temperatures and environmental conditions are presented. Finally the measurement uncertainty of the LWIR-pyrometer is deduced.},

abstract = {The viscoelastic response of commercial aluminum alloys 7075-T6 and 2024-T3 as a function of temperature is presented. Experimental data are obtained with a dynamic-mechanical analyzer (DMA) at different loading frequencies and compared with the available transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data. The effect of successive microstructural transformations (particle precipitation and redissolution) is revealed. An analytical model is developed, which fits the mechanical response up to 573 K (300 °C). The model takes into account the concentration of Guinier-Preston Zones (GPZ) and metastable precipitates ($\eta$′ in AA 7075-T6 and $\theta$′/S′ in AA 2024-T3), allowing us to determine the kinetic parameters of these transformations. The activation energies were previously obtained by several authors from DSC measurements and other techniques, showing considerable dispersion. The presented data, obtained with a completely different technique, allow us to reduce the uncertainty on these data and show the potential of DMA measurements in the study of microstructural transformations. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Minerals, Metals {\&} Materials Society and ASM International.},

abstract = {This dissertation explores the link between civil-military relations and international conflict. In particular, I ask whether strategies that leaders invoke to protect themselves from their own militaries might under some conditions increase the risk of war. Even though civil-military relations is fundamental to state-building, and despite the sizable literature on domestic causes of international conflict, there is very little work on the international implications of regimes' efforts to protect themselves from their own militaries. My argument is that when coups are possible, usually leaders divide their armed forces into rival organizations that they intend to check and balance each other and protect the regime as a by-product of mutual suspicion. (I label this strategy counterbalancing). Counterbalancing depends on leaders' ability to keep their own armed forces apart by promoting conflict among them. But military elites may rebel if they come to understand how leaders profit from inter-organizational hostility. Hence, counterbalancing requires leaders to conceal control benefits they accrue when they induce their own forces to compete. Because international conflict conceals these benefits, leaders may invent enemies, prepare for war, and engage in low-level international disputes when their foundational objective is to use counterbalancing to subordinate their own militaries. Contrary to the sizable literature on scapegoating, my argument is that in the realm of civil-military relations regimes may use provocative foreign policy to reinforce institutional divisions rather than to achieve cohesion. The argument is tested via a multi-method strategy that includes a pooled, time-series analysis of almost every country in the world over the last two decades of the Cold War as well as historical case studies of civil-military relations in Syria in the early 1970's and Georgia in the mid-1990's.},

It is well known that the voltage amplitude from low-profile piezocerarnic sensors used for inspection may change not only due to damage but also due to an inappropriate transducer coupling and temperature effects. The paper studies the effect of temperature on Lamb wave responses. The work involves a simple experiment in which two piezoelectric ceramics are bonded on an aluminium plate. The plate is exposed to various levels of temperature. A couple of simple features extracted from the Lamb wave responses are analysed to show the effect of the temperature changes. The plate was later subjected to damage and the series of tests and analysis repeated in order to give some comparison between the effects of damage and temperature change upon the responses. Several ways of how this problem can be circumvented using appropriate signal processing techniques are discussed.},

abstract = {In broad terms, there are two approaches to damage identification. Model-driven methods establish a high-fidelity physical model of the structure, usually by finite element analysis, and then establish a comparison metric between the model and the measured data from the real structure. If the model is for a system or structure in normal (i.e. undamaged) condition, any departures indicate that the structure has deviated from normal condition and damage is inferred. Data-driven approaches also establish a model, but this is usually a statistical representation of the system, e.g. a probability density function of the normal condition. Departures from normality are then signalled by measured data appearing in regions of very low density. The algorithms that have been developed over the years for data-driven approaches are mainly drawn from the discipline of pattern recognition, or more broadly, machine learning. The object of this paper is to illustrate the utility of the data-driven approach to damage identification by means of a number of case studies. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Royal Society.},

Acoustic transducers are mounted at the bases of the quartz pins that hold up the silicon wafer during rapid thermal processing. An electrical pulse applied across a transducer generates an extensional mode acoustic wave guided by the quartz pins. The extensional mode is converted into Lamb waves in the silicon wafer which acts as a plate waveguide. The Lamb waves propagate across the length of the silicon wafer and are converted back into an extensional mode in the opposite pin. The time of flight of the extensional mode in the quartz pins is measured using pulse echo techniques and is subtracted from the total time of flight to obtain the Lamb wave time of flight across the wafer. Because the velocity of Lamb waves in the silicon wafer is systematically affected by temperature, the measurement of the time of flight of the Lamb wave provides the accurate temperature of the silicon wafer.},

Next, we examine guided-wave theory, tracing its early history down to modern developments. Following this, we detail the efforts into models for guided-wave excitation by SHM transducers. Then, we review several signal processing related works. The next topic in Section 6 is guided-wave SHM system development, and we explore various packaging ideas, integrated solutions and efforts to examine robustness to different service conditions. We also highlight the broad spectrum of applications in which this technology has been tested.

Both piezoelectric angle beam transducers and high frequency laser scanning vibrometer (LSV) are used to detect ultrasonic signals in the Ti alloy specimens with different plastic strain levels. Technical features and outcomes with use of piezoelectric transducers and LSV are compared. The method using piezoelectric transducers, with much higher signal-to-noise ratio than LSV, has been further improved by deploying two transducers with central frequencies corresponding to the fundamental and second order harmonic signals respectively to improve the testing reliability and accuracy. Both the techniques using piezoelectric transducer and LSV demonstrate consistently that the acoustic nonlinearity increases with plastic strain, and the second harmonic Rayleigh ultrasonic wave can be utilized for effective determination of yielding in Ti alloy. Our experiments further show that the acoustic nonlinearity increases gradually with plastic strain at small plastic strain level, and there is a more significant increase of acoustic nonlinearity when the plastic strain reaches a higher level. Microscopic investigations using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) are conducted for clarifying the relationship between the observed acoustic nonlinearity and micro-structural changes.},

abstract = {Piezoelectric materials that can function at high temperatures without failure are desired for structural health monitoring and/or nondestructive evaluation of the next generation turbines, more efficient jet engines, steam, and nuclear/electrical power plants. The operational temperature range of smart transducers is limited by the sensing capability of the piezoelectric material at elevated temperatures, increased conductivity and mechanical attenuation, variation of the piezoelectric properties with temperature. This article discusses properties relevant to sensor applications, including piezoelectric materials that are commercially available and those that are under development. Compared to ferroelectric polycrystalline materials, piezoelectric single crystals avoid domain-related aging behavior, while possessing high electrical resistivities and low losses, with excellent thermal property stability. Of particular interest is oxyborate [ReCa4O (BO3) 3] single crystals for ultrahigh temperature applications ({\textgreater}1000°C).

abstract = {Inspection for corrosion and pitting defects in the petrochemical industry is vital and forms a significant fraction of the operating expenditure. Low frequency guided wave inspection is frequently employed as it gives large area coverage from a single transducer position. However, detection becomes problematic at inaccessible regions such as pipe supports or beyond T-joints since the low frequency guided waves produce a significant reflection from the feature itself, hence limiting the defect detectability of the method. This suggests testing at higher frequencies which helps to minimise the reflection from the feature and also improves the sensitivity to smaller defects. There are a number of guided wave and related techniques implemented for corrosion inspection including the S0 mode (at ∼ 1 MHz-mm), SH0 and SH1 modes (at ∼ 3 MHz-mm), CHIME, M-skip and Higher Order Mode Cluster (A1 mode at ∼ 18 MHz-mm). This paper presents a systematic analysis of the defect detection performance of each method with sharp and gradual defects, as well as their sensitivity to attenuative coatings, liquid loading, surface roughness and ability to test beyond features such as T-joints. It is shown by finite element analysis backed up by experiments that the A1 mode provides the best overall performance when dealing with surface features such as T-joints and coatings because of its low surface motion. Additionally a combination of two or more methods is suggested for corrosion inspection at inaccessible locations: The A1 mode in reflection for severe, sharp, pitting type defects; long range guided waves in reflection for large-area thinning and the SH1 mode in transmission for shallow, gradual defects.},
