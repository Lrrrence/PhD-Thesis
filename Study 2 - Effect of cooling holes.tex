\section{The effect of hole size on reflection amplitude}

The change in reflected signal amplitude with respect to hole size is investigated in this section. Two wedge transducers are arranged in a pulse-echo configuration, whereby the wedges are placed close to one another, one acting as the transmitter and one as the receiver. A single transducer setup was considered however the difference in amplitude between the excitation signal (10 V) and reflected signal ($\sim$50 mV) makes digitisation difficult, without either losing the reflected signal in noise or overloading the excitation input. By using two transducers the sensitivity of each channel can be adjusted to match the signal amplitude accordingly.

\subsection{Determination of transmission distance}

As the calculation of group velocity is dependant on accurate knowledge of the distance between transducers, an initial test is carried out to determine the distance from transmitter to receiver via hole reflection. Firstly, the transducers are aligned on axis with no hole present, spaced apart by 100 mm (as in previous experiments) and time of flight is measured ($t_{\textrm{aligned}}$). The wedge-to-wedge time ($t_{\textrm{wedge}}$) and offset distance ($d_{\textrm{offset}}$) are also measured, as described in~\cref{experimentalstudy}. The group velocity ($v$) can now be calculated using Equation~\ref{eq:velocitytext}. Next, the time of flight from a reflection is measured ($t_{\textrm{reflected}}$), as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:topdownholespacer}. Now the distance travelled in the plate between transducer faces ($d_{\textrm{reflected}}$) can be calculated (Equation~\ref{eq:dreftext}) by multiplying the velocity ($v$) by the reflected time of flight ($t_{\textrm{reflected}}$) minus the wedge-to-wedge time of flight ($t_{\textrm{wedge}}$), minus the offset distance ($d_{\textrm{offset}}$). This distance can now be used in future tests to measure a change in velocity with temperature.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:velocitytext}
    v = \left( \frac{d_{\textrm{aligned}} + d_{\textrm{offset}}}{t_{\textrm{aligned}} - t_{\textrm{wedge}}} \right)
    \tagaddtext{[\si{\meter\per\second}]}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:velocitynum}
    5099.18 = \left( \frac{0.1 + 0.04587}{5.812{\times}10^{-5} - 2.951{\times}10^{-5}} \right)
    \tagaddtext{[\si{\meter\per\second}]}
\end{equation} 
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:dreftext}
    d_{\textrm{reflected}} = v \times \left(t_{\textrm{reflected}} - t_{\textrm{wedge}} \right) - d_{\textrm{offset}}
    \tagaddtext{[\si{\meter}]}
\end{equation} 
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:drefnum}
    0.178 = 5099.18 \times \left(7.335{\times}10^{-5} - 2.951{\times}10^{-5} \right) - 0.04587
    \tagaddtext{[\si{\meter}]}
\end{equation}

A 3D printed spacer has been designed to allow transducers to be accurately and repeatably aimed at a hole. The angle of incidence/reflection can easily be adjusted. 

In this configuration a reflection is received from the hole, followed by a stronger reflection from the edge of the plate. The angle between transducers is kept at a minimum to most closely mimic a pulse-echo configuration using only one transducer.

\subsection{The effect of hole size on signal amplitude}

The setup shown in Figure~\ref{fig:topdownholespacer} is used to compare the difference in reflection amplitude between different hole sizes. The tests are carried out on three different plate thicknesses (1 mm, 2.5 mm, and 4 mm), targeting three different Lamb wave modes ($S_0$, $A_1$, and $S_1$ respectively). The signal amplitude is highly dependant on the coupling between wedges and plate, so fresh couplant is applied for every test, and an average amplitude is calculated after multiple removals and replacements of the wedges. The reflection angle (36\degree) and distance (0.178 m) between transducers is kept consistent across all measurements. A 60 dB voltage amplifier is applied to the receiver transducer. 

Reflection amplitude is measured at hole sizes of 1.5 mm, 2 mm, 2.5 mm, 3 mm, 3.2 mm, 3.5 mm, and 4 mm. Absolute peak amplitude is measured using MATLAB. The wedges were removed from the plate and the couplant was reapplied five times for each hole size, taking ten measurements per reapplication, for a total of fifty measurements per hole size. The edges of the holes were deburred on both sides of the plate after every new hole was drilled.

Results for the $S_0$ mode are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:holeampboxplot}. The mean is shown in green. There is a linear relationship (R$^2$~=~0.9994) between increasing hole size and increasing amplitude. The average increase in amplitude for a \diameter~0.5~mm change in hole size is 0.216~V $\pm$ 0.014~V.

\end{figure}

Results for the $S_1$ mode are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:holeampboxplotS1}. The mean is shown in green. There is a linear relationship (R$^2$~=~0.9909) between increasing hole size and increasing amplitude. The average increase in amplitude for a \diameter~0.5~mm change in hole size is 0.027~V $\pm$ 0.03~V.

\subsection{Conclusions}

The $S_0$ mode is significantly more sensitive to changes in hole size than the $A_1$ or $S_1$ modes. The large in-plane displacement of the $S_0$ mode (Figure~\ref{fig:S0throughthickness}) is very sensitive to defects at any depth (such as holes), whereas the $A_1$ and $S_1$ modes (Figures~\ref{fig:A1throughthickness} and~\ref{fig:S1throughthickness} respectively) exhibit a lower sensitivity due to their middle thickness nodes. Results are in line with those reported by Jeong \textit{et al.}~\cite{Jeong2000}.

The increased sensitivity of the $S_0$ mode may be advantageous in differentiating between different hole sizes on an NGV, where the holes along the leading edge of the vane may use a different geometry than the rest of the holes.

\section{3D Simulations}

A 3-dimensional COMSOL model has been developed to investigate the effect of cooling holes on wave propagation. The cooling holes found on nozzle guide vanes are often arranged in rows, aligned from the inside edge to the outside edge of the vane. The proximity of the rows to one another often increases towards the leading edge. Each row can have $\sim$30 holes, and there can be $\sim$5 rows in close proximity to the leading edge. An example of which can be seen in \cref{fig:ngv}. Simulations are carried out in increasing complexity, beginning with a single hole, and incrementally increasing the amount. The input point is moved in the $y$-axis with respect to the rows of holes, to investigate how the response changes.

The general effect on wave propagation with multiple holes present is investigated. The plausibility of monitoring temperature changes at multiple locations is also investigated. Additional simulations are carried out at higher temperatures.

To reduce the complexity of the model, and therefore computation time, transducers are omitted from the model. Using a prescribed displacement node as both a transmitter and a receiver is not normally possible, as the displacement is clamped at zero after the excitation, acting like a fixed and rigid boundary. There are two methods of avoiding this. One is to use a boundary/point load to apply a force in the $z$-axis, which allows the boundary/point to freely deform after excitation. Another option is to split the study in to two steps, where the first step only covers the time required for excitation, and the second step covers the rest of the simulation. As no excitation occurs in the second step, the point/boundary is able to freely deform and act as a receiver. An additional point probe is placed on the far edge of the plate, to act as a receiver. This allows both pulse-echo and pitch-catch configurations to be analysed. Displacement in the $z$-axis is measured in all cases. Low reflecting boundaries are applied to every plate edge, to allow them to act like infinite boundaries. A swept mesh is used for the bulk of the plate, which dramatically reduces the number of domain elements in comparison to using a tetrahedral mesh. Ten elements per wavelength are used throughout the model. The area around each hole is meshed using tetrahedral elements (in a box measuring 2x the diameter of the hole), to ensure that the geometry of the hole is represented accurately, and the edges of the holes are meshed using 10 fixed elements. With one hole present the average element quality is 0.991.

Initial simulations are carried out on a plate measuring 70x20x1~mm, targeting the $S_0$ mode at 1 MHz, using two-sided excitation. The distance between the transmit/receive probe and the first hole is 50~mm. The plate material is Inconel 718, as used in previous studies.

Each hole has a diameter of 0.75~mm, and are spaced 2~mm apart. 

Increasing the number of holes in the $y$ dimension causes an increase in signal amplitude, with no additional reflections present.
